 h-p announced tuesday that it will **[ buy ]** the outsourcing services company for $ 13.9 billion . 

 the repercussions from the **[ merger ]** of electronic data systems ( eds quote - cramer on eds - stock picks ) with hewlett-packard ( hpq quote - cramer on hpq - stock picks ) will ripple broadly throughout the tech industry . 

 industry sources have confirmed to eweek that hewlett-packard will **[ acquire ]** electronic data systems for about $ 13 billion . 

 overall , my take is that this **[ transaction ]** sounds great in theory , but there many potential pitfalls . 

 for high-end enterprise it services before this **[ merger ]** , the market consisted of ibm and everybody else . 

 industry analysts contacted by eweek generally say they believe that hewlett-packard 's forthcoming $ 13.9 billion acquisition of electronic data systems ? announced officially on may 13 is a good **[ move ]** for both companies , although there will be the usual integration snafus over vendor neutrality issues , business lines , culture shock and layoffs .

 at least initially , sturm said , there will be little noticeable impact on customers from the **[ deal ]** . 

 bill ritz , eds spokesman , pointed out that hewlett-packard 's **[ acquisition ]** of eds still needs the approval of regulators and eds ' stockholders . 

 **[ acquiring ]** eds also could yield more government work for hp , which had about $ 500 million in prime federal contracts in fiscal 2007 . 

 with a market value of about $ 115 billion , hp could easily use its own stock to finance the **[ purchase ]** . 

 hewlett-packard is negotiating to **[ buy ]** technology services provider electronic data systems in a deal that could help the world 's largest personal computer maker snap up more data management and consulting contracts . 

 if the deal is completed , it would be hp 's biggest **[ acquisition ]** since it bought compaq computer corp. for $ 19 billion in 2002 . 

 it 's too early to tell what impact - if any - hewlett-packard co. 's decision to **[ acquire ]** electronic data systems corp. will have on eds ' operations in south charleston , an eds spokesman said . 

 earlier this month hewlett-packard unveiled a bid of nearly $ 14 billion bid to **[ purchase ]** eds . 

 hewlett-packard ceo mark hurd believes that the $ 13 billion **[ acquisition ]** of electronic data systems will help build out hp 's enterprise services offerings and " accelerate " the company 's reach into new accounts , he said . 

 in a may 20 conference call with reporters to announce hp 's 2008 second-quarter financial earnings , hurd offered his thoughts on the upcoming **[ acquisition ]** of eds . 

 hewlett-packard 's ceo says he believes the eds **[ acquisition ]** will make the company 's service offerings stronger . 

 hp estimates that the **[ deal ]** , when completed , will give it about 7 percent of the technology services market , compared with ibm 's 10 percent share . 

 hewlett-packard 's **[ purchase ]** of electronic data systems could mean tougher competition for ibm and its 10,500 triangle employees . 

 " it appears to be a very daunting **[ deal ]** , " said american technology research analyst shaw wu . 

 the all-cash **[ deal ]** , announced tuesday , represents hp 's biggest gamble under the leadership of mark hurd , who was hired as chief executive in march 2005 to turn around the maker of personal computers and printers .

 a **[ jury ]** found scott peterson guilty friday of killing his pregnant wife , laci , and their unborn child in the saga of suburban adultery and betrayal that transfixed much of the nation for nearly two years . 

 laci peterson 's loved ones have " a hole in their hearts that will never be repaired , " a prosecutor told jurors today as he asked **[ them ]** to send convicted double-murderer scott peterson to his death for killing his wife and unborn son . 

 the **[ jury ]** convicted the 32-year-old peterson on nov. 12 of first-degree murder for killing his wife and second-degree murder for the death of his unborn son . 

 dozens of people in laci peterson 's hometown who were donating blood in her memory applauded when they heard a **[ jury ]** 's decision to execute scott peterson for the murder of his pregnant wife . 

 peterson was found guilty because **[ jurors ]** believed he had a motive to kill his wife and that peterson 's conduct -- before , during and after laci peterson 's disappearance -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental . 

 in essence , the **[ jury ]** concluded that the circumstances surrounding laci peterson 's disappearance and death could not reasonably be explained in any other way but that scott peterson wanted her dead so he could continue and perhaps expand his secret life with amber frey . 

 scott peterson has been found guilty of first-degree murder , a verdict that means he could be executed if these same **[ jurors ]** vote as the " conscience of their community " that he deserves to die for his crimes .
