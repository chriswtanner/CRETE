Im against this.. should of said lol
Horrible aggression by the father.
if you go around trying to beat people to a pulp for no reason you deserve to get stabbed
I wouldn't have a machete lying around in my parking attendant office, but if two big guys came in and started trying to beat me with weapons I certainly wouldn't have any qualms about using anything at hand to get rid of them.
Not a nice outcome by any means, but certainly understandable.
Good.
Karma is a bitch, purely self defense and I would have no problem stabbing him, I'd probably take pleasure knowing I was well within the law to do so.

Brought to justice for what? If the video is to be believed, the attendants clearly acted in self-defence.
Should of decapitated the ***** and bathed in their blood.
I'm upset...
...that the father wasn't killed as well
I'm confused - when does he get stabbed in the chest? He is punching him and then they both run out the door at the end... or am I missing something?
Serves the ***** right.
Punk got what he deserved for trying to beat people up. The dad should of got stabbed too.
Effectively signed his own death warrant
The attendants did nothing wrong, although in this country they would most likely have got 20 years in jail for murder.
disgusting!
When he just comes in and starts going postal with that massive shovel... :O
He pleaded.... not guilty <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm2.gif" alt=":facepalm2:"/>
I forgot what state they're in but if they have the 3 strike law, he will get life without parole.
