URUMQI, July 7 (Xinhua)
Riot-plagued Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, was slowly returning calm but traffic blockade remained in some streets
Monday night after the riot on Sunday evening killed at least 156 people.
Police officers were seen wearing riot gear and standing guard in downtown
areas. Police vehicles kept patrolling the blockaded streets including Xinhua
South Road and Renmin Road Monday night.
Debris has been cleared from most of the roads, but few people were seen in
major markets or buses.
Bus stations near the People's Square, where the riot started, were cancelled.
Most shops in areas where the violence occurred remained closed as of Monday
night.
Up to now 156 people have been confirmed dead and more than 800 were injured in
the riot.
Rioters burned 261 motor vehicles, including 190 buses, at least 10 taxis and
two police cars, said Liu Yaohua, the region's police chief.
Police have detained about 700 people in connection with the riot, including a
dozen who were suspected of fanning the unrest. Police are still searching for
about 90 other key suspects in the city. Liu said.
