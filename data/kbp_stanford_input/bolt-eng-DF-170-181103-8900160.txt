Corp is created, gives Mitt 1mil, then disolves
Great now anyone in the world can give to American politics.
well as long as they are wealthy enough.
Money = FREE SPEECH.
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE.
Get used to it.
the rich just have more to say.
Money makes you more verbal I guess
think of how many mormans could do this.
The morman church gives them money, they form a corp, they donate that money and boom you have a really wealthy morman candidate.

Good gawd you must be loaded.

And is it any wonder why this country is bordering on collapse!!!

Were you this put out about foreign donations to Obama online during the election?
You know like being a crab is wealth to you.
you just have more bitch inside you than most.
These rich people aquire a few things to say with each dollar they pocket.
Its what the founders intended.
Everyone gets a say.
The wealthy just get more words because......well.......hell....... they made more money (or were given more money by someone)
Now people who have wealthy churches, or wealthy friends, or just get paid to be mommentarily wealthy to transfer these funds into campagin coffers have sooo much to say.

MORMON, you MORON.

Gee thanks I guess I better learn how to spell it sense they may own the country soon
You don't sem to have a problem with Unions donating to Obama. Hell. They got payed back big time. Just ask the folks who had money invested in GM and Chrysler. They got hosed big time.
Bet you don't have a problem with that though. Right??

I wonder how all of those poor people were able to come up with 50K to spend the evening celebrating Obamas birthday...and wow...poor people spending 10K to get a picture taken with him.

Now you sound like a bigot
The ONLY way we are ever going to fix what is wrong with our government is by throwing the money changers...oops, I mean lobbyists out.
Public financing of elections is the solution. No corporate or special interest money allowed AT ALL, period.
I guess this didn't bother her at all either.

No Im not a fan of any organized religion.
I dont want any religion tainting my government.
Historically its been real bad for humans when ONE religion gets too much control
I'm sure she never questioned this either
I guess this didn't bother her at all either.
BP and its employees have given more than $3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years, with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donations come from a mix of employees and the company’s political action committees — $2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP-related PACs and about $638,000 came from individuals.
Where did I say it didnt bother me?
Both you and I have likely never voted for someone who has not been influenced by this type of money.
Now its going to be a free for all.
TM is a bigot.
TM is a bigot.
Yes. I see that.
Sadly, she doesnt.
So guys are you happy that this money is now going to be so easy to hide?
yeap me and the founders agree no religion should run our government.
So guys are you happy that this money is now going to be so easy to hide?
Not overly concerned. I am sure you will make sure it is not hidden.
SO all is good.
Your thoughts on Obama getting millions in donations from those that have wealth, but no longer have taxable income?
TM is a bigot...who knew?
yeap I guess me and the founders are bigots under your definition of the word

The politics of money. Of course, it only soils the other side. If it is for my side, it is righeous. LOL

Obama managed. Why not Mitt?

wow... we agree on something. Who'd have thunked it? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>
I guess this didn't bother her at all either.
That's different of course. It wasn't 'really' a corporation donating, as that is not legal. It was a bunch of people who make up the corporation. And it was to Obama, so that itself makes it OK.
the rich just have more to say.
Money makes you more verbal I guess
It would be refreshing if for once you actually had something to say.
yeap I guess me and the founders are bigots under your definition of the word

Kind of like Vanilla Ice comparing himself to the Beatles.
I like the founders know that religion and Government has been horrible for any people living under neath it.

why not Sponsor an amendment to the Constitution preventing all but atheists from running for President?

Yeah, so do I.
But you're still a bigot.
So you disagree with me and the founders about religion being bad for government?

Why would I do that?
I never said anything about the poerson running having religious beliefs.
I just dont want the church of ANYTHING effecting our elections, you know just like the founders.
You can start a thread about it if you like.
This thread is about poeple creating a corporation JUST to funnel money into a campaign.
Do you think that is good for our country?

Few do.
So, why are you such a bigot about Mormons?
So you disagree with me and the founders about religion being bad for government?
The Founding Fathers did NOT think that 'religion' was bad for government, dipshit.
They thought the idea of a 'state sponsored religion' was bad for government.
There is a significant difference between your position and that of the Founding Fathers.

I also think there should be a law that a white person is not to donate to white candidates and blacks to black candidates to ensure no one is allwoing race to dictate who they donate to.
Aferall, we certainly dont want race to dictate politics.
I see nothing wrong with a Mormon wanting to support a Mormon candidate. They have similar beliefs, ideologies and a comfort zone of knowing the candidate has a similar thinking as the voter.
Afterall, isnt that what choosing the candidate is all about?
Great now anyone in the world can give to American politics.
well as long as they are wealthy enough.
Yet one more lie told by truthdoesn'tmatter. The title of her thread is a bold faced lie.
The money wasn't given to Romney as her title states it was. It was given to a "pro-Romney group."
I know she's not smart enough to see the difference, but once again we have proof that truthdoesn'tmatter is a liar.

Money = FREE SPEECH.

corporations are not people, but a result of peoples actions.
Can a corporation be sentenced to jail time?

I know! Just look at G.E. all owning the White House and stuff!
