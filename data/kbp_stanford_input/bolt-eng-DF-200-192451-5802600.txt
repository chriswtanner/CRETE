Tamil Self-Immolation
Tamils setting themselves on fire. Is this what it takes to for the world to pay attention to the situation in Sri Lanka?
The UK-based family of a young Tamil man who set himself on fire in protest at the treatment of his countrymen in Sri Lanka has said they are proud of his actions.
Thousands of Tamils living in the UK and beyond are expected to attend the funeral on Saturday in Northolt, west London, of Murugathasan Varnakulasingham, 26, who travelled to Switzerland last month to kill himself in front of the United Nations building in Geneva.
Mr Varnakulasingham, a computing graduate who worked part-time in a supermarket, had attended demonstrations to protest against the Sri Lankan military's war against the Tamils, an ethnic minority who are fighting for their independence.
Thousands of people are have been killed, and thousands more displaced on the island since fighting escalated after 2005.
...
Mr Varnakulasingham's death appears to have inspired at least one other "copycat" suicide attempt in the UK - a man thought to be a Tamil who tried to set himself alight outside Downing Street last month.

Guess if you're not a Palestinian people just don't care. I'd be shocked if this story gets even 2 minutes of TV time.

Looks like its taken a fair bit of time for the BBC to pick up on this story seeing as it happened last month and there was another suicide in relation to the matter last month.
Give the Tamils their ******* independence already. They don't want to be part of Sri Lanka, how hard is that to understand?
I fully support Tamil independence and the Tamil Tiger rebels.

I don't see the world anxiously watching a small corner of North West London...
On why Tamil Tigers deserve independence but Tibetans/Taiwanese do not... obviously <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

Because the Tibetans do not have a strong case for independence. It has a history of being part of China, dating back to at least the Qing Dynasty. It is sparsely populated and weak internally, and it has few functioning institutions or strong politicians. There is little case for self-governance, it would be very weak by itself. The Tamils, on the other hand, have a case for independence because of their position as a significant minority in Sri Lanka, their traditional segregation, and their long and hard war for independence. If they can fight with internal institutions, they can win. The same goes for Tibet. If it were to show a significant will to fight and rebel against the Chinese, it might have a good case for independence through solidarity.
Taiwan has traditionally been part of China. The culture is quite similar. It is the outpost of the last remnants of the Chinese Nationalists. Granted, it has a stronger case for independence than both Tamils and Tibetans because of its well-functioning government and institutions.

Before 1959, the present extent of the Tibet Autonomous Region (comprising Ãœ-Tsang and western Kham) was governed by the government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama. Other parts of historic Tibet (eastern Kham and Amdo) were not under the administration of the Tibetan government during the twentieth century; today they are distributed among the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.
That's a pretty strong claim to independence I would argue. Not to mention that what you would consider a lack of solidarity is in essence nothing more than the fear of opression. Fists talk. Combine this with the lack of foreign media - a subsequent result of the Chinese government's regime.
The 'One China' policy is imperialistic. Hong Kong should have a referendum as well.

No, it'd take a whole lot more than that.
Sri Lanka, Burma, East Timor etc., don't even feature on the radar of most 'leftists' concerns. In fact, I'd be willing to bet the majority of the (pick and choose any of the following: ) anarchist, socialist, communist, pacifist, pro-Palestinian, progressive, environmentalist, collectivist, federalist, feminist population don't even know what's going on in these places. If they really gave a ****, things could change, but these people are just pathetic, self-conscious, pseudo-political posers who have an image to uphold.
Its a shame they don't receive more media coverage
A nation, therefore, has no right to say to a province: You belong to me, I want to take you. A province consists of its inhabitants. If anybody has a right to be heard in this case it is these inhabitants. Boundary disputes should be settled by plebiscite. - Ludwig von Mises, Omnipotent Government
The right of self-determination in regard to the question of membership in a state thus means: whenever the inhabitants of a particular territory, whether it be a single village, a whole district, or a series of adjacent districts, make it known, by a freely conducted plebiscite, that they no longer wish to remain united to the state to which they belong at the time, but wish either to form an independent state or to attach themselves to some other state, their wishes are to be respected and complied with. This is the only feasible and effective way of preventing revolutions and civil and international wars. - Ludwig von Mises, Omnipotent Government
It's pretty convenient for Sri Lanka if news of the war doesn't break out. I'd say there definitely must be some kind of media blackout.

Why do you say that? Is there also a media blackout on the situation in Congo? Uganda? East Timor? Mexico?
Why did the British media give so much attention to Gaza but virtually ignore the synchronic Sri Lanka conflict, a humanitarian disaster that cost more than 10 times as many lives as in Gaza?

Do you want to back that up? Figures I saw on HRW said 2,000 dead in a 2 month period while approx. ~1000 in 23 days, in Gaza.

Unfortunately the nature of the conflict makes it difficult to produce accurate numbers. The Sri Lankan government sure isn't producing numbers that are even remotely realistic. Any evidence I post on here will just be dismissed by you as Tamil propaganda because the source is Tamil. That said, the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/iha1248.doc.htm">UN puts the conflict's death toll at over 67,000.</a>
I urge you to take in a variety of sources in researching the civilian death toll of the conflict. "Official" figures coming out of Sri Lanka are extremely misleading. But even completely unrealistic figures put the death toll much higher than Gaza. How fair is that?
I'm still shocked that there's still 247 coverage on Gaza and Palestinian protests when we hear stories like this (within the last day I may add):
Sri Lankan attacks kill 208 civilians within 72 hours
( <a href="http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=28639">http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=28639</a> )
Why is there so little coverage on this? But of course...
Round the clock coverage on all news channels. Front page on every major newspaper.
Tamils protesting around the world, including 50,000+ in London. Barely a mention.
Irrelevant
Not Palestinian? Well we don't care then!
Yawn.
Better heal up quick missy, there's no televised DEC appeal for you.

Well the UN [from your source] says 3,000 since 2006, HRW says 2,000 in the last two months (compared to Gaza 1,000 in 23 days). That's a start. Hardly fair you are using the figure of 67,000 for a conflict going on for 25 years, need I remind you how long the Arab/Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been going on for? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

I thought we discussed the media issue already....

It's a completely different issue.

First world nation - killing 1000s of civilians in a month &gt; Ongoing struggle with rebels in a third world country.
The British media (like all media) want to make money. No one is going to give a toss about Sri Lanka compared to 'Operation Cast Lead'. Thus, the extra attention.
But like I said, there is definitely a media blackout, to some extent. As for the '10 times as many lives', most of the people died were soldiers on both sides; it was a war on battlefields. What Israel did can loosely be described as terrorism - leaving mountains of innocent civilians in their pursuit for justifiable targets from 5000 feet in the air. It's bound to sell more than rebel uprisings.

No, people don't care if you're an idiot.
What is it with you people and suicide? You're obsessed with it, regardless of religion and culture. So this foolio sets himself alight in some attempted profound political statement which not only achieves nothing, but IMO merely questions his mental state and reflects badly on him in general. Yet his parents are proud? Not only shocking, but embarrassing. What a needless waste of a life. In any case, I reckon he did it cuz he was a depressed graduate in a dead end job <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>
Did MLK shoot himself in the head when it seemed he wasn't making any progress with the movement? No! Because it would = one less political activist = ultimately pointless.
LOL ypo, I thought you lot had such impressive IQ's which put most others to shame? This seems kinda dumb to me - but hey, just an alternative opinion. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Branching out from just Sri Lanka (as you don't appear to quite understand the situation at hand), what about East Timor? What about Burma? Are these 'rebel uprisings'? I see a much greater case for the accusation of terrorism and, indeed, genocide, in these situations than in Israel.

What happened in East Timor and Burma? Enlighten me.
It's disappointing that the Tamils feel so underrepresented that they have to resort to this. :\
The Tamil Tigers should not be supported: they are a terrorist militant group who have indulged in actions such as attemting to bomb the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy which would have killed thousands and thousands of innocent, peaceful Sri Lankan people if it had been successful.
The Tamals need to realise that the Sri Lankan government don't care about even the main population of Sri Lanka. When the tsunami hit there were huge aid appeals - I was in Sri Lanka not long after and the place was full of rubble, the only help was independant charity organisations: the government did absolutely nothing. (Where did the aid money go? Well, a new palace sprung up around this time, hmmm.)
This is so clearly the governments fault, and theirs alone. NOT the general population, so the tamal tigers terrorist attacks are never going to achieve anything beyond killing innocent people and making onlookers less sympathetic to their cause.
If the government doesn't care about Sri Lankans even, why would they care about Tamals? Sadly it is a lost cause without intervention from other states - the plight of the Tamals is something I have every sympathy for and I would like to see them become an independant nation in the north of Sri Lanka but to achieve that the Tigers must disband, and they must be seen as a legitimate cause to the rest of the world. In other words stop bombing innocent people you goons!
