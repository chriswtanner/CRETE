Hi All,
On December 10th I was caught by an police officer driving too fast, I received a fine and I was told that I would get three penalty points.
I paid the fine two days later and presented my licence at the police station as requested, however this was returned to me at the time.
As of yet I have heard nothing more about the penalty points, how are these added? My licence was renewed on Friday and when it arrived in the post it had no points on it - what should I do?
From what I know, they are meant to keep your licence and sent it away to get endorsed when you hand it over.
I wouldn't worry about it cos there will be a record to say you produced so you are ok on thar score. Cos you've paid the fine, I'd say you are scot free, so you can start celebrating!
It's their slip up so that'll be the end of it!

I thought you could pay Â£85 and do a one day course and avoid losing the three points. My uncle has just done this.
It depends on how many m.p.h. over the speed limit you were doing. Get caught doing 39 in a 30 and you may be lucky enough to be offered the speed awareness course and a fine instead of points, get caught doing 55 in a 30... that's a different story.
speed awareness course is only for people who have no other points on their licence and can only be offered in place of a fixed penalty notice, i dont think the police are allowed to offer it if they pull you over, its only if you are caught by a camera and have a letter come through your door. so yeah i think you have gotten away with it anyway! and since it isn't on your licence and you have renewed and it still doesnt show then don't tell anyone about it, then you wont have to worry! insurance companies need never know, as they wont be able to find any record of it anywhere!
How much was the fine?
how soon after you were caught speeding did the letter arrive? i was overtaking a slow driver on a climbing lane towards ballymoney last saturday. there was a camera van sitting at the bottom of a hill and i was doing about 65 in a 60 zone, didnt see the van until it was too late so i couldnt do anything about my speed. Just a bit worried as i have only been driving for 18months and really dont want any points... <img src="http://static.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/yabb/sad.gif"/>
I've been told that there's a 10% allowance so as long as you weren't doing over 66 you ought not to get a ticket. Fingers crossed.
its actually ten percent plus 3 as far as i know, but thats only for actual real life human police, the speed cameras will get you at 5pm over the limit, i think they only "activate" and take the photo if you are over 5mph over, but i think you will be fine tbh. you could also appeal if they said it was only a few mph over as their equipment can never be 100% accurate and neither will your speedo be 100% accurate.

Its 10% + 1 not 3
Wasn't the 10% allowance scrapped when the speed awareness courses were introduced?
