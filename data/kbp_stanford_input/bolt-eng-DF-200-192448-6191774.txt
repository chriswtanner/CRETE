How many dictators are there in this picture?
Hot on the heels of the Great Leap Forwardesque "Big Society" we have: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-my-war-on-multiculturalism-2205074.html">Cameron: My war on multiculturalism. No funding for Muslim groups that fail to back women's rights.</a>
A little voice at the back of the class might mutter: "Muslim groups don't need funding because they get all that oil money from Saudi Arabia". What this will do though is stop Christian groups getting any money unless they spout radical feminism.And since there are far more Christian groups this policy to implement the cultural supremacism of "Muscular Liberalism" is essentially anti-Christian.
Hence the need to ask the question:
There are three dictators in that picture.
A loosely democratically elected leader of a majority coalition who can be democratically jettisoned after a few years by a large amount of people is not a dictator just because his policy chooses to halt public funding for groups which don't treat women with respect.
Jesus Christ.
3 not including cameron
Depends on your definition of 'elected'. And also whether you can be both elected and a dictator.
David Cameron was elected by the people of Witney. There is, however, not really any such thing as an "elected Prime Minister". That seems a rather semantic argument though.
Adolf Hitler was originally elected, as well as supported by trade unions.
The Bolsheviks in Russia did originally have some sort of elected political base.
Mao, as far as I'm aware, was never elected.
Is there any modern comparison at all between David Cameron and the other 3? No. Do I understand what the OP's post is even about? No.
So ****ing stupid. A democratically elected leader who wants extremist Muslim groups to respect women's rights and various other rights stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Oh what am I thinking! He sounds exactly like ****ing Mao!
Where's the option for zero? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":unsure:"/>
Only one is a dictator.
The others were all elected.

Dictators can be elected, you know; just think of Palpatine.

None of these distinctions are relevant. You might want to have a look at some commonly accepted definitions of ' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> '. Dictatorships can be initially elected. Non-elected Prime Ministers in our UK Parliamentary system cannot be dictators, assuming the laws are abided.
So no, it doesn't depend on your definition of 'elected'. You've reached the same conclusion as me, but your reasoning is irrelevant, imo.

You can be elected and subsequently become a dictator.
All four are dictators. If you don't think Cameron is a dictactor, just ask yourself why he pleads for the people to "give something back" and "contribute to society" when he himself has given nothing back and has contributed nothing except to push his own agenda?

A dictator assumes absolute power, hence why I would argue you can't be elected and a dictator - you were popularly supported to have that power.
Cameron backs women's rights... and that makes him a dictator?
Three Authentic dictators, one potential dictator.

This.
None.
None are dictators. Poor poll - no option for 0.
To call David Cameron a dictator is to belittle the suffering of the oppressed citizens in countries actually under the thumb of real dictators.
Stalin, Mao and Hitler.
Actually, I'm with Cameron on this one. Reactionary religious groups don't deserve our money. This is Britain, we believe in liberalism and equality for all.
I deeply dislike words like dictator. There is only power, even those with immense amounts of power are constrained by what their society will tolerate. Is a man who gets his way the entire time by pursuing an agenda within the bounds of his society more of a dictator than a man who only gets his way a small amount of the time but pushes the boundaries?
What about a weak leader surrounded by men who otherwise agree with his agenda. Although he is weak, his agenda is still implemented.
I personally think Cameron is my weak leader description. He is weak and personally cannot be called a powerful man in any meaningful sense of the word - but he is a figurehead for an ideology that has a powerful grip on the nation due to no opposition (Labour, LibDems and Conservatives are effectively different wings of the same party).
All four are dictators. If you don't think Cameron is a dictactor, just ask yourself why he pleads for the people to "give something back" and "contribute to society" when he himself has given nothing back and has contributed nothing except to push his own agenda?
Martyn does it yet again.
Being a hypocrite is not the same thing as being a dictator. You're well on your way to holding the same level of credibility as Teveth.
P.S.
As for Cameron's position regarding money for religious groups - they shouldn't have any period and any advocating religious extremism should just be deported to Somalia.
Cameron backs women's rights... and that makes him a dictator?
Cameron wants a world where women don't have a choice about what kind of woman they want to be. That indeed is jackboot territory.
"Women's rights" does not mean "a culture good for women" or even "made for women, by women". It's a specific culture that benefits the ruling elite - who incidentally, ignore the strictures of equality in their own lives, for example by sending their kids to sex segregated schools - by wrecking the families and life opportunities of the poor.
The new policy is not about fighting Muslim extremism - radical Islamists like wahabbis are funded from abroad, not the state - but about reducing the flow of money to Christian charities and organisations, because Christianity, Jesus's message of love, threatens the one world culture of permanent war of dictators like Cameron.
Cameron is many things, but he is not a dictator

LOL if you say so.
Personally I think he just doesn't approve of marginalizing women in the name of Islam, but each to their own.

I never suggested a Prime Minister in a parliamentary system could be a dictator in such circumstances. Instead I was trying to pre-empt any suggestions to the contrary, based exactly on that flawed reasoning.

I made a mistake then, sorry.

Yet but all who gain power are afriad to lose it, especially the conservatives. Although the party you want to watch out for is the BNP those people are dangerous and if they ever get into ower god help us.
You can hardly put Cameron on the same level as Hitler, Stalin or Mao and I doubt you ever will be able to. There's a very good chance that Cameron will never gain absolute power and could never become a dictator. I don't think what he said means that you can justify calling him a dictator. He is many things but a dictator he is not.
