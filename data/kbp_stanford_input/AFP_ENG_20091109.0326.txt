Bulgarian given life sentence in Iran for drug smuggling: ministry
SOFIA, Nov 9, 2009 (AFP)
A Bulgarian truck driver was sentenced to life in prison in Iran after being
caught smuggling drugs, Bulgaria's foreign ministry said Monday.
Ministry spokesman Dragovest Goranov said the driver, Zhivko Rusev, was informed
late Sunday of the court's decision, but that the foreign ministry had not yet
received the reasons for that ruling.
Rusev, 55, was arrested near the Iranian town of Tabriz in September 2008, after
130 kilogrammes (286 pounds) of heroin were found in his truck. He has been in
prison in Iran since then.
"Rusev maintains his innocence and we will advise him to appeal," Goranov said
Monday.
"Regardless of the sentence, we estimate that there is some light at the end of
the tunnel as the ruling was not the death penalty," he added.
Under Iranian law, drug trafficking is punishable by death. Dozens of men are
hanged each year in Iran on drug trafficking charges, according to reports.
