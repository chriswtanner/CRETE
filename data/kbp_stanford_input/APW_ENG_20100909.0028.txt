LOS ANGELES 2010-09-09 00:36:20 UTC
A former bodyguard for Britney Spears claims in a lawsuit that he was subjected to repeated sexual harassment by the singer.
Fernando Flores sued the pop superstar and Advanced Security Concepts Corp. in a suburban Los Angeles court Wednesday for unspecified damages. He claims the 28-year-old singer repeatedly exposed herself to him.
The lawsuit also claims Spears berated him at a movie theater and that he witnessed her act inappropriately in front of and toward her young children.
An e-mail to Spear's publicist Holly Shakoor was not returned. A woman who answered the phone at Advanced Security declined comment.
Flores was hired in February 2010 but does not state how long he worked on Spears' detail.
