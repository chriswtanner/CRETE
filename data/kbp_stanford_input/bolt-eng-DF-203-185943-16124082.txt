Rutgers student convicted
A jury found a former Rutgers University student guilty of invasion of privacy and some bias intimidation charges in the webcam-spying trial, deciding that he was motivated by homophobia when he streamed video of his roommate’s intimate encounter with another man.
After less than three full days of deliberations, the five men and seven women of the jury found Dharun Ravi, 20 years old, guilty of invading the privacy of his 18-year-old roommate, Tyler Clementi, and his dorm-room date. They also found that Ravi was motivated by bias in at least some of the charges in the case under a New Jersey hate-crime law that had been largely untested so far.
The jury had been asked to decide Ravi’s motivations when he trained his webcam on Clementi and his date on two separate occasions in September 2010, in a case that set off a national conversation about cyber-bullying and treatment of gay youth. Clementi, a quiet freshman and gifted violinist who had told his parents he was gay days before leaving for college, killed himself by jumping off George Washington Bridge shortly after he learned about the spying.
Ravi was not charged in connection with the death. He showed no reaction as the jury forewoman read the verdict. Families for both sides filled five benches of the packed courtroom, remaining stone-faced as the verdicts were read.
Ravi faces up to 10 years in prison on most serious bias intimidation convictions, but is likely to receive a lesser sentence based on sentencing guidelines because he is a first time offender.
I am really happy they found him guilty.
I am happy (though surprised) that he was convicted of all counts. I guess the jury didn't believe his attorney's assertation that he was just being "immature".

he wasn't.
I don't know how I feel about this.
It's hard for me to believe the intent was that malicious that he thought he could seriously jeopardize Clementi's life somehow. He does sound immature and I think he should have been found guilty on at least several of the charges, because what he did sucked and he should get some sort of punishment for it. But I'm really surprised he was found guilty of the most serious of the charges as well.
I'll think about this and read up on this some more but I don't feel thrilled about this verdict right off the bat.
marie, i've been following this trial pretty closely (well, as closely as you can through the media) and ITA with you. i don't think this guy was out to "hurt" anyone (physically). he sounds like a huge douchebag.
here's a piece i read earlier this week that, if it is all true, really shed some light on it for me:
I am sad about the verdict. I don't think he was being malicious where he thought someone would die. He was being an ahole and immature, but I don't think he ever thought someone would kill themselves from his actions.
It is just unfortunate for everyone involved. 2 lives completely ruined.
I'm conflicted by this too. Was there the intent for Clementi to kill himself? No. But was there intent to make fun of him and embarass him? Absolutely. I'm not willing to chalk this up to pure immaturity.
I think his actions need to be punished, but I don't think 10 years in prison is the answer.
I am glad he was convicted on all counts. Sure, Tavi probably didn't intend for Clementi to kill himself, but he wasn't tried for manslaughter or murder. I do absolutely think that what he did was a bias crime.
In addition to the possible 10 years in jail, he also faces possible deportation after his sentence since he's an Indian citizen.

This is how I feel. I do feel it was a hate crime.
But I don't think 10 years is necessarily the answer.
And even though he isn't a US citizen, I believe he grew up in NJ.
His lawyers should have made him take the plea bargain.

He did grow up in NJ - Plainsboro. I didn't realize that he just rejected a plea bargain in December that would have just given him probation, community service and counseling, and would have probably eliminated the chance of deportation. He's an idiot, and knowing he rejected a deal like that, I wouldn't even feel bad if he got the max.
I also hope that this serves as a wake-up call to kids everywhere - that cyber bullying is no joke and they risk ruining their lives if they choose to engage in it.
Since when is immaturity of a college student a legitimate legal defense?
I'm sorry for the DUI, I was being immature and doing keg stands. Can I go now?
he was NOT convicted on all counts. he was convicted on parts of all the counts. it's not the same thing.

If he's the one that really made the decision to reject that sweeta$$ deal, then I don't feel bad for him at all.

His lawyers couldn't have rejected it without his approval, right? I mean, sure they could have recommended that he not accept it (although I don't know why they would do that), but ultimately wouldn't the decision have been up to him?

not when it comes to possible sentencing and deportation. the severity of the crimes he was actually convicted of will be what determines his legal status in the end.

I agree. And the fact that he tried to influence witnesses ticks me off.

It's irrelevant for the purposes of discussion here about whether people here are sad that he is facing 10 years and deportation.

What I'm pointing out is the fact that because he wasn't found guilty on all parts of the charges, the likelihood of his receiving the max/being deported is diminished. That's entirely relevant to the topic, IMO.
Yes, the likelihood is diminished. That isn't my point, but it's clearly not worth trying to further explain.

I would bet money that the lawyers were counting on a more sympathetic jury because the case included sexual orientation-motivated bias. I'm sure the lawyers thought he would be acquitted and recommended he not take the plea bargain. He should have taken it. What he did was reprehensible and the choices he made (especially the witness tampering on top of it all) were really poor from start to finish. I don't buy the "immaturity" defense for a second. In what world is that a defense?
