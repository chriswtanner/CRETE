Divorce deal clears Malik to wed Mirza: complainant's mother
Hyderabad, India, April 7, 2010 (AFP)
The celebrity wedding between Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik and Indian tennis
star Sania Mirza was back on track Wednesday after a deal was struck in which he
"divorced" another girl.
Preparations for the high-profile couple's upcoming nuptials had been marred by
claims by Indian woman Ayesha Siddiqui that she and Malik were married in 2002
-- sparking a scandal that captivated millions across south Asia.
"Divorce papers have been signed," Farisa Siddiqui, Ayesha's mother, told a news
conference in Hyderabad. "The settlement is done."
The deal apparently ends a complex and often contradictory tale during which
Malik had consistently denied ever being married to Ayesha.
After Malik and Mirza announced they would get married on April 15, Ayesha made
a range of accusations including that she and Malik had signed a "nikahnama"
(wedding agreement).
She also lodged a complaint with police in Hyderabad, prompting officers to quiz
Malik over the saga and confiscate his passport.
