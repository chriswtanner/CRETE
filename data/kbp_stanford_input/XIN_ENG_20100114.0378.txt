New governor elected at Tibet's regional parliament session
LHASA, Jan. 15 (Xinhua)
Padma Choling, a native Tibetan and former armyman, was elected governor of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region Friday at the regional parliamentary
session.
He has replaced Qiangba Puncog to be chairman of the regional government. The
ongoing session of the regional People's Congress endorsed Qiangba Puncog's
resignation earlier on Friday.
Padma Choling, born in 1951, is a native of Dengqen in Qamdo Prefecture. He
served 17 years in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) between 1969 and 1986,
before he became an official in Tibet's regional government.
He was elected vice-chairman of the regional government in 2003.
Earlier this month, he replaced Legqog to be deputy secretary of Tibet's
regional committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
Padma Choling will meet the press later Friday morning.
