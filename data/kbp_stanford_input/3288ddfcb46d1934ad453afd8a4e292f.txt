I for one am happy to see this happen so fast and sure. Internet Crimes need to handled swiftly every time.
I think a message has to be sent that this kind of thing as well as threats and intimidation that take place all the time.
The one thing I will say is when you do do this, and perhaps these young fellows deserved it... you set a dangerous precedence that can be grossly misused.
The courts are going nuts and it is shocking. There was a woman who got jail time for accepting a pair of sports pants from her boyfriend who looted them. She did not know they were looted. People who normally would get bail are not getting bail but are remanded in custody. People who would normally for said crime get a fine or community service are thrown in jail. And then these two guys.. so much for free speech.
All this because of pressure from the Conservative part of the government on the judges... the other coalition partner, the Lib Dems are not happy, nor are most legal experts. I would wager most of these cases will not only be appealed but also have their sentences reduced considerably.

How is that, it's already illegal to incite a riot and people have been arrested for making threats on the Web so the laws are there. I just want to see them carried out swiftly.

So if someone if someone sets up a webpage saying to harass the Conservative Prime Minister, should he be arrested for threats? I agree with Jetboogieman, this is setting some very dangerous precedence... something that both sides of the political spectrum would gladly exploit if they could.

Well let me ask you this.
I distinctly remember after the health care vote, someone actually said on this site "We should blow the dome off of congress".
Now should that person who said that in the heat of the moment be thrown in jail for four years?
Do you think he actually intends to blow the dome off the building?

Free speech? They were clearly organising violent activity, that's not covered.
This isn't something new. Just the venue they were caught in. In the past if someone was suspected of committing a crime the authorities would have to go to the trouble of getting a phone tap or something. Once a conversation was recorded where they were planning something illegal, they would get arrested.
Now people are stupid enough to plan their illegal activities out in the open where anyone can freely see them.

Were they? The problem is the riot that they supposedly were organising...... never happened.

It is not necessarily a dangerous precedent, as its one thing to dispute authority and another thing entirely different to attempt to gather a following and cause harm to public &amp; private property or individuals, whether they represent authority or just get in the way due to disappointment, anger, or other malaise no matter the reason. To keep and maintain law, order and justice, through laws and courts, is governments biggest reason to exist.

People do this every single day on these boards and across the internet, media and so on. Very few of said "bantering" goes anywhere and none are convicted let alone arrested. In this case nothing came out of their "bantering" and yet they are now going to jail for 4 years. So yes it is a very dangerous precedent.

Yes, they were. Look at the quotes. It's irrelevant whether they managed to follow through.
The person who plans to kill someone but the authorities step in are still arrested and charged.

Exactly. Police are not going to wait outside until the person is actually killed to make an arrest. Likewise, if police know that a "riot" is being planned, they're going to be there first to keep order. That doesn't give the people who planned and incited the riot a pass.
This is organized criminal activity. The laws in this regard, in the US anyway, are pretty serious. I don't think that these young people thought this through.
The same goes for the Americans who are engaging in similar behavior. It won't be a pretty thing when the chickens come home.

Problem is, nothing happened. The riot they were advocating for never happened... no one showed up. I could understand if there was an actual riot, but since there was not, then it is nothing but the usual bantering on the internet. By this ruling many on these boards could be thrown in jail.....

Maybe I've missed something, but has there been an instance where members of this forum have suggested meeting at a specific spot to engage in criminal activity?

Actually their is a HUGE difference between, people disagreeing with in insulting and rude ways even going to the point of an actual threat and creating a webpage with the sole INTENT to organize a group in real life to carry out violence and rapine destruction upon people and property !
