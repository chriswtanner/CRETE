McCain versus Putin : Bring it on
If anything will get Tom Clancy back on the typewriter full time it's McCain versus Putin in Vladimir's back yard!

It will certainly be interesting to watch if McCain is elected President. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>
Dread I think the Russians will adopt a far less aggresive approach for starters...

I do know one thing, A few of these sabre rattling countries are going to go quiet if hes elected and they know exactly who they are. The man is a soldier at heart Translation: A go getter. First and foremost he will complete the current mission. His next move will be bringing the troops home to a well deserved welcoming. Not what he himself and other troops experienced after returning from Vietnam. Then he will start manuvering. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

Er, don't you think it wise to wait for the results of the forthcoming election before we indulge in flights of a) imagination, b) rhetoric or c) whimsy? This blasted dollop of politics has been going on for far longer than most of us can stand - and you want to raise the level of hyperbole still further? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/confused.gif"/>
Uncle Glyn - Where's your sense of adventure?
Clancy always seemed to have a hard on for post Cold War Russia.
However, he hasn't done any new research since 1990, if the Bear and Dragon is anything to go by.
Yep but this may well bring him out.....
Bet Larry Bond and Pat Larkin are sharpening their pencils as we speak...

I kinda did too. Always thought that they'd be a good partner for the 21st century. Turns out they like being grumpy imperialists instead. Bummer.

after yeltsin and his western advisors effed things all to hell in the mid-90s and let the oligarchs take over, i felt that "partner" was not going to happen.
after putin got on board, i no longer felt that- i knew it. McCain had putin's number.
Is my call right guys?
In a conventional NATO blows Russia out the water even in her backuard?

I held out hope until I saw them letting their free press get extinguished by the government with nary a squeak. In the end I have to remind myself that Russia remains full of Russians.
And I agree with your last - tsar Putin never pulled the wool over McCain's eyes.

oh, the russians squeaked alright- but when oil money started making them better off and russia started getting military muscle once again, they abruptly shut up. results count for more than the means, i suppose.
there's the pity of the thing- had yeltsin not been so utterly hapless as a leader when it came to economics, he could have really made russia a partner. instead, his actions ended up undoing much of what made him famous in the first place- as well as the hatred of his own countrymen.

No, Russia got too much depth.
Well you quote Andrew Sullivan, whom I often read, but he isn't exactly an unbiased source, and distorts McCain's bellicosity a little. Even if McCain wants to attack any sustained use of force against Russia would have to be approved by the House and Senate-Democratically-controlled, and that is unlikely to happen.
McCain will probably just settle for arming and training various members and ex-members of the CIS. I don't think anyone to the left of Michael Savage is crazy enough to attack Russia either conventionally or through the nuclear option.
Yeah, it's not worked out well for anyone in the past.

From what I understood Jeffrey Sachs was an advisor to Yeltsin and he promised western aid (IMF) if Yeltsin would privatise the economy. When he did privatise the west (IMF) decided it wasn't going to happen.
My source is just one book however; although very well documented, it has alot of opinion in it as well. ( <a href="http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine">The Shock Doctrine | Naomi Klein</a> )
Guys - what would happen if McCain was in and Israel attacked Iran?
As things stand Syria and Russia have just entered into new defence arrangements.
Would Russia be bold enough to try and assert some authority in the ME while the Caspian Basin is still on a knife edge?

Russia will never be quiet since S.Ossetia conflict!
He's a soldier?! Oh damned! everybody is frightened now!!! Haha! do you really think so??
I should tell you one secret thing.... about 80% of our government are ex-military Generals)))))))))
I thing Obama is more intellegent to be a president of US.
Guys I have done an article which refers to this marvellous board which I will post later.
I want to run some "war games" on our site which is a South African national newspaper.
You'll get the idea when I post it.
man to man putin would kick Mc Cain's a**, he is a black belt after all <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>
Yeah!!
I should tell you one secret thing.... about 80% of our government are ex-military Generals)))))))))
Horse Puckey!
Normally when I have a problem with a black belt I take along my cousins, you may know them - Smith and Wesson...
russians have been known to bring uncle kalashnikov along when they go to meet cousins smith and wesson <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>
Then I'll introduce a dear friend of mine Grandpa RPG....(on my wife's side)..

This the same intelligence that just relinquished ties to NATO as punishment?
I dont know who is more pathtic in that line of thinking Vladmir or the current "puppet" president. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/rolleyes.gif"/>
PSST, Its not a secret and hasnt been since the Korean War! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/rolleyes.gif"/>
I "thing" perhaps learning to spell might show more intelligence and perhaps some better use of the English language might sufice. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>
Now we should kick their ass out of G8 and be done with them. ABM shields for all and Putins head will pop. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> )

whether or not that's true, that's not the main reason why the russian economy went to hell. main reason was because the idiotic "shock doctrine" allowed people with connections/money from the old regime to buy up hundreds of suddenly privatized companies. also, without a good judicial system and intellectual rights protection, these chaps also knew how to game the system.
caused a few people to become immensely wealthy and impoverished the rest. the oligarchs then used their money to influence the government to change the rules to benefit them further.
given this, i'm not surprised that russians weren't too eager to become partners of the west. they had been screwed by taking some spectacularly bad advice by people who didn't understand how idealistic theories just don't play out in the real world.
As world affairs would have it..

Yes Uncle Glyn but they'd probably pitch up with Stalin's organ...

How does putin relate to the oligarchs? (as in what's his political relation)
Putin gets along fine with them PROVIDED they don't try and get involved in politics.
See Siberia/Oligarchs/Politics....
They're probably expected to pitch in a little bit to United Russia, but that's no problem since they did the same for whatever Yeltsin's political vehicle was.
