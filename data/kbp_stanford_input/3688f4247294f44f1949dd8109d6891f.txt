Johnny Depp: Winona Forever
Soon after co-starring in Edward Scissorhands, Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp were engaged to be married. Ever the romantic, Depp had "Winona Forever" tattooed on his arm as a sign of their undying love...
When the couple split up just three years later, Depp had the tattoo surgically altered. The new version? "Wino Forever."
[In order to mark important events in his life, Depp regularly indulged in self-mutilation. "In a way," he explained, "your body is a journal and the scars are sort of entries in it." Among his other tattoos? A Cherokee Indian chief on his right arm and his mother's name ('Betty Sue') on his left arm above the bicep.]
Heh Heh! Love it, Cav
