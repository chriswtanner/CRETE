NigeriaÂ’s deal to drop Cheney charges called illegal
Lawyers and media pundits in Nigeria are accusing the government of acting illegally by agreeing to settle criminal bribery charges against Dick Cheney out of court.
Nigeria charged Cheney and applied for an Interpol arrest warrant earlier this month in connection with a $180-million bribery case. Cheney's former employer, Halliburton, reportedly agreed to pay $35 million to see the charges dropped.
Moral of the story? If you're rich enough, you' can pay your way out of a jail cell with ease. The corrupt, avaricious, chickenhawk bastard is going to get off scot-free.
Does any rational American (with the exception of hate-filled anti-American radical lefties) think Nigeria's indictment of the former Vice President of the United States should be taken seriously? Don't make me laugh.
Yep, Nigeria is a bastion of honest politics.
Are the American left really this stupid?
You mean the Interpol clusterfuck that originally issued the warrant for Cheney now has to issue a warrant for the government of Nigeria?
Suh-weet!
Who the heck cares about Nigerian "Charges".
Probably one of the most corrupt governments in Africa.
they should have extradited his ass and let them waterboard him til he confessed :P
Nigerian officials say they made the deal because they weren't certain they could get a guilty verdict against Cheney.
Just a minor detail. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>
