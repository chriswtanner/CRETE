s/o Car insurance
Do you pay your whole premium in full or do you go month to month?
There is a discount for paying it in full, so that is what I do.
Month to month automatic payments.
I pay in full every 6 months. The discount is worth it.
I paid ours in full during our last policy period, but I don't think we got a discount for doing so. I need to call our insurance and ask about this policy period since the first payment is due this month.
We pay month to month right now...I should look to see if there is a discount for paying in full, if there is I would definitely do that!
Month-to-month, automatic payment. We wouldn't get a discount if we paid in full.
I pay in full every 6 months, the discount is worth it. I really want to know what other people pay. I feel like pots is so expensive!
I'll share.
Our premium is 1200 for 6 months. I know... ::heave:: We can thank H's tickets and two claims in two years on that. lol Our deductible is also 250 on both cars.
We pay monthly and auto draft.
We pay month to month auto draft and get a discount.
Month to month. We pay $89 for full coverage on two cars. $500 deductible.

Oh dear god. I'm jealous.

Geico! It was a little higher but if you go on their site and update info they give discounts for living in a certain area and other things too.
Month to month, it $189 a month for our two vehicles. I can thank my car accident before E and I got married for that one. However I turn 25 next month so it should be going down some. YAY!

We used to have Geico, but they ended up more expensive than what we're paying now.
I'm sure if we upped the deductible, it would help a ton, but I'm afraid to do that. lol
We have USAA and pay $120 a month for full coverage on 2 trucks and 1 motorcycle with a $250 deductable. You have no idea how shocked I was when my 2009 truck went from $100 a month alone to an additional $20 a month to be added on DH's policy. WTF man.
