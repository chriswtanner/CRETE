A paroled rapist was arrested early Tuesday after attacking a 19-year-old woman in East Harlem, officials said.
The victim had gotten out of a cab and was walking along Madison Ave. near E. 135th St. at 4:30 a.m. when Demetrius Edwards, 34, of Brooklyn, allegedly grabbed her, threw her between two parked vehicles and slammed her head into the ice and snow.
A resident in a nearby building came to the womanÂ’s rescue and thwarted Edwards when he heard screams, cops said. The good Samaritan threw open his window and yelled that he was going to call 911.
