WWYD - edible arrangement edition
Right after I got home from work, our doorbell rang. It was a new neighbor who lives a few doors down. We've waved to each other before, but never really spoken.
She had an edible arrangement for us. EA tried to deliver it to our home around noon, but since we weren't home, they left it with the closest home neighbor. weird.
Anyways, the EA wasn't for us. It was addressed to the guy we bought our house from in November 2009. It was sent from his work (info courtesy of a public linkedin account) with a message for a "speedy recovery."
I called EA around 6pm and explained the situation in case they wanted to come pick it back up. EA said they would call me back right away after talking ot the manager. It's now 845pm with no call back.
Here's the dilemma: it's in our fridge, and the chocolate covered strawberries look delicious.
WWYD? They wouldn't leave a EA at someone's house overnight and then ask for it back, right?
The thought of the company giving that arrangement to somebody else after a botched delivery is crazy.
You should eat it.
Not your problem.
They aren't going to come pick it up from you and give it to him. At least I hope not! If anything, they'll make a new one and send it to him. Eat away!
They can't take that and redeliver it. That's just gross.
Eat away!
That stuff won't last til they come and get it. Eat those strawberries!
I agree with eat it, and I'm jealous.
Thanks for the confirmation of my thoughts! I'm ripping it open now <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-19.gif" alt="Party!!!"/>
Eat it! We got Hope's Cookies delivered to our house for the old people from a law firm for Christmas, and I gobbled them up without a second thought. It would be gross for a company like EA to pick up fruit from your house and deliver it from someone else. It's yours, now :-)

Geez, someone was way off there.

Excellent reminder why it is so important to update your address with HR. You might miss an Edible Arrangement!!
