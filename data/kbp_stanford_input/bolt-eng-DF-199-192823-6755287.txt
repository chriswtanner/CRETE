Oooh. U.S. rescues Iranian ship held by pirates
Hmmm. I think I think this is good.
Comments?
@ossobuco,
Meanwhile, that ship captain's entire family is likely being held and tortured into disavowing him as an American spy.

Androcles and the Lion I think it isn't.
@dlowan,
Me either, but interesting.
@ossobuco,
Any rescue of any people from the clutches of Somali pirates is good, yes.
@Lustig Andrei,
How is it that I don't trust anything?
Well, skipping along, I take this as good.
When countries cooperate in matters of international law, it can only be good thing. There was an interesting aricle on Iran in yesterday's Guardian, which I've already posted on another thread, but I'll post it here as well.
In other words, confident statements by the White House and state department that Iran is buckling under sanctions pressure appear to blithely ignore the possibility that the regime is being pushed into a corner from which it will come out punching, not negotiating. One result may be an acceleration of its nuclear activities â€“ the opposite of what Obama wants. And then there is the unpredictable Gulf tinderbox. Fearing fatal insurrection at home and with their oil exports blocked, Khamenei and the mullahs, egged on by trigger-happy Revolutionary Guards, may choose to export chaos instead.
