Football: Barnes faces taxing time after bankruptcy
LONDON, Oct 21, 2009 (AFP)
Former Liverpool and England winger John Barnes insisted on Wednesday his
bankruptcy was due to a "tax oversight" which was being addressed.
Barnes, who began his career in English football with Watford, was declared
bankrupt by an insolvency court last week.
But Barnes said: "The bankruptcy issue is a tax oversight which is being dealt
with."
Barnes, who was sacked as manager of English third tier club Tranmere earlier
this month, was in charge of his native Jamaica last season.
