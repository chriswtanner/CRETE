Spanish royals holiday in Majorca, two days after deadly bombing
madrid, Aug 2, 2009 (AFP)
Spain's King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia traveled to their summer residence in
Majorca Saturday just two days after a bombing blamed on Basque separatists
killed two policemen on the resort island.
Juan Carlos said he felt "happy and safe" but said efforts to destroy the
separatist group ETA must continue.
"We must go on and on hitting them in the head and we must fight to stop them,"
he told reporters at the airport Saturday evening.
The royal couple then traveled to the Marivent Palace near the Majorcan capital
of Palma to start the royal family's annual summer holiday.
On Thursday, two policemen were killed in a bomb attack in the resort of
Palmanova near Palma.
A day earlier, a massive car bomb exploded outside a police barracks in the city
of Burgos on the Spanish mainland, injuring 64 people including several
children.
Authorites blamed ETA for both attacks.
Spanish police in the past have foiled ETA attempts to kill Juan Carlos,
including a plot to shoot him in 2004.
A Basque newspaper reported last April that ETA had plotted to blow up a
helicopter or airplane carrying the king using a surface-to-air missile.
ETA is blamed for the deaths of 828 people in its decades-long campaign for an
independent Basque homeland encompassing parts of northern Spain and southwest
France.
