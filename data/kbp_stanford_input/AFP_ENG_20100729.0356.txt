Georgia seizes Ukrainian ship for visit to rebel Abkhazia
TBILISI, July 29, 2010 (AFP)
Georgia on Thursday seized a Ukrainian cargo vessel and arrested its crew for
visiting its Moscow-backed rebel region of Abkhazia on the Black Sea.
"The coast guard has seized the Ukrainian dry cargo vessel 'Accord' and arrested
its crew -- 12 of whom are Ukrainian citizens and one a Russian citizen -- for
breaching regulations on entering Abkhazia's maritime zone in Georgia's occupied
territory," Coast Guard officer Ramaz Tedoradze said in comments shown on
Rustavi-2 television.
The channel reported that the vessel, loaded with wheat, was anchored at
Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti and that an investigation was under way.
Georgian law bans economic activities in its breakaway regions of Abkhazia and
South Ossetia without Tbilisi's consent.
Foreigners can face prosecution if they enter the territories without the
central government's permission.
Georgia seized at least four ships headed to or from Abkhazia last year,
infuriating the region's rebel leadership, which threatened to destroy any
Georgian ship violating its de-facto sea borders.
Georgia last summer sentenced a Turkish sea captain to 24 years in prison for
visiting Abkhazia, but he was later released under pressure from Ankara.
Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke from Tbilisi's control during wars in the early
1990s and were recognised by Moscow as independent states after the August 2008
Georgia-Russia war.
