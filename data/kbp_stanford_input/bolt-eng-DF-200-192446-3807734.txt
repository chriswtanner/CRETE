BREAKING NEWS: Another British Citizen Being Snatched Away By American Authorities.
A retired British businessman has been handed over to US marshals at Heathrow to be extradited to the United States to face charges that he illegally exported weapons parts to Iran. Christopher Tappin, who is 65 and lives in Kent, will be escorted across the Atlantic today. He was being accompanied by his tearful wife Elaine.
Tappin, who said he was full of trepidation about his fate, denies any wrongdoing and says he is the innocent victim of a sting operation by US agents.
He is being extradited under a controversial treaty signed off in 2003 by both the US and UK governments, which allows American prosecutors to demand British suspects are handed over without their cases ever being tested in a British court.
Today he labelled his treatment a "disgrace" as he arrived at Heathrow police station."I look to (Prime Minister David) Cameron to look after my rights and he has failed to do so.
"I have no rights. Abu Qatada is walking the streets of London today and we cannot extradite him. He has more rights than I have.
"If I was a terrorist I would not be going to America. I think it's a shame, a disgrace.
"The Conservative government, while in opposition, promised to reform the law and they failed to do so and they've let me down, they've let you down, they've let the whole country down."
This was interesting - even after he fought against it in UK+European Courts, he's still being extradited:
Now, I'm not here to hysterically scream 'outrageous' etc etc and it is not greatly an issue whether he did or did not do what he is accused of.
However, it is a cause for concern regarding the circumstances in which the American authorities are allowed to take our citizens.
Does this go both ways? May the UK also demand extradition of an American citizen?
And the HRA 1998/ECHR cannot help any citizens of this country at all in being extradited? Is this not some breach of rights?
It was mentioned in the article that this so-called treaty rendered the British authorities and lawyers powerless to try to stop it - really?
Incidentally, if he is successfully charged and loses his case, which prison will he be imprisoned in - a British or an American one?
So for example, if I were to suspected by the American authorities of doing something dubious related to them, say for example, purchasing a machine gun with the supposed intent to supply it to Iran, could I simply be extradited such as this man?
Thus, either there is something seriously wrong here with the UK in this matter, or there is some below-the-limelight corruption and Mr Tappin is caught up in it....?
Your thoughts on this matter?
This is not breaking news for starters. I do feel sorry for him, American prisons are inhumane and animalistic. I dont know how a country like the UK can agree to this. But thats what you get for living in United Britain.
This is not breaking news. Stop being an attention seeker.
The treaty between the US-UK is ridiculous. They wouldnt like it if we wanted to extradite a US citizen.
British justice for British citizens!
This is a bit odd...they have been on Babar Ahmad's case for ages and he has been in prison for 6 years without a charge. He is too a British citizen, but i guess because he is a Pakistani he deserves less attention then a white British citizen. So much for the rule of law

Why does the article say the case was not tested in British courts but then that he fought extradition for years? Surely by fighting extradition the nature of the case and if a crime has been committed is going to come up? I don't like this that much or the treaty but in this case I don't see there being much difference between him being tried here or in the US. Either way he is going to get his day in court and a chance to defend himself.

But the laws in the US or different from the laws in the UK, though they may both be common law jurisdictions. What if I, being a British citizen, murdered an American citizen who was on holiday in the UK. Surely, I would and should be tried in a UK court?
But what if I, being a British citizen, hired another British citizen to kill an American citizen on US soil? Who gets to charge me for the crime? Supposedly my hitman will be deported or something; but me?
I think this calls for extensive research....

Surely you would be though? Is it not fair that if you killed an American in the US or took actions that primarily hurt the US that you stand trial there?
As for the latter example you would both be deported.
The point is the law gives us no home rights and the conservative government has done nothing about it.
Glad I'm leaving UK when I graduate.

American court.
Fair trial.
Pick one.
this isn't even a case of a crime being committed in or against america by the sound of it, so I don't quite understand why they feel the need to try him there. I mean, at least the guy who hacked the pentagon actually committed a crime against the US government. this guys crime affects us as much as the US, he should be tried here
words dont even begin to describe how angry stories like this make me... its obscene, he's an elderly retired business man who sold batteries?! he didnt sell the iranians plans for a nuclear war head, he didnt sell them missile designs, its a battery... the Americans and their backward and perverted 'justice' system are making an example out of him just like the chap who was arrested for tvbox or whatever the site was called a couple of weeks back... this extradition treaty needs scrapping, no civilised nation would dare send their citizens to a country like america to be dumped over in their justice system, least of all for such petty crimes as this... we deport pensioners but let terrorists walk the streets of london, very eloquently put by this poor gentleman.
We should have asked the Americans to extradite all the US citizens involved in selling weapons to the IRA.
USA- biggest hypocrites ever.
The USA has NEVER refused the UK an extradition request.
to me this sounds a bit fishy, i work for company that exports materials for use in military applications and the rules are really strict and obvious. For example you cant even export 1g of something that might have a use in a military application without a license and all these things are written down and have to be to comply with the law. I personally don't see how its possible to export something without knowing even somewhere else in the uk let alone Iran. if you tried to send anything there it would have been picked up on for sure.
If this was a genuine mistake then obviously i do feel sorry for the guy but im not so sure it was.

Im not saying that the treaty is fair or that I agree with it, but the USA has yet to refuse an extradition request by the UK.

I do, they are spineless, ineffectual wimps with no sense of who's country they are serving anymore.
His seem fairly rich so shouldn't have trouble finding any competent lawyers. His been fighting this for two years and his claims have been found to not hold up so don't see the problem.
"A massive review of extradition led by a senior judge said critics misunderstand how the legal safeguards work.

The US courts system is a mess. No way he will get a fair trial, most likely he will be black mailed into a plea bargin and the other defendants will be black mailed into giving evidence against him. The man only made $500 from the FBI sting operation.
US Court system works on commission more prisoners more money.
