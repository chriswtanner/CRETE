Death Penalty, Yeah or Nai?
Seeing as this is likely going to be a hotly debated topic in the coming weeks why not discuss it on here.
Personally i am all for it and always have been, pedophiles, rapists and some murderers should be executed in my mind plain and simple. They have given up their right to live by ruining the life of another. Would also stick a clause in there to make it easier to apply to re-offenders, to act as a serious deterrent to paroled scum.
Discuss, im sure all you lefties out there are going to scream human rights and wave the white book in my face.
I'm a leftie yet I'm for the use of the death penalty for SERIOUS crimes (i.e. serial rape/murder)...I truly believe that some criminals will never be successfully rehabilitated
and therefore the death penalty should be put to use.
For it, only for crimes that are horrific and there is 100% proof of the killer. Thing is, is that we will get many problems where mentally unstable people commit murder, so what would happen then? Murder is murder isn't it?
well done for creating thread number 17583245534214 on capital punishment on tsr. Here, have a wine gum.
I'm neither for or against but I think they should change prison sentences to actually be there for life. Not released early for good behaviour that's *******s. Let them rot in there
We already have several very recent and active threads on this topic:
