SAN FRANCISCO - Two of the three American hikers jailed in Iran after allegedly straying over the Iraq-Iran border in 2009 were to be married on Saturday in a private ceremony in California, according to a statement posted on their Facebook page.
The wedding of Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd completes an engagement that began when Bauer tied a ring of thread around her finger while they were in prison in 2010.
"Now that this day has come, all I can do is close my eyes and fill with gratitude, for our freedom, for the love of so many generous people around the world, and for the very soil under my feet," Shourd said in the statement posted on the Free the Hikers Facebook page.
The third hiker, Josh Fattal, was to be the best man, the statement said.
The statement did not say exactly where in California the wedding was to take place, only that it was a setting "chosen for its pastoral beauty."
"Becoming engaged to Sarah while we were in captivity allowed me to dream of a future that was not only secure, but also beautiful," Bauer said in the statement.
Bauer, Shourd and Fattal were arrested on July 2009 by Iranian border guards, who allege that the three crossed over into Iran from the Iraqi Kurdistan region.
1. Hope somebody bought them a GPS for a wedding present.
2. They might also want to avoid "hiking" or "selling art" on military bases and DEA offices.
3. Let's hope there aren't any children. Really, the world doesn't need more stupid people in the gene pool.
"Hey! Let's take a hike on the border of a paranoid, totalitarian Islamic theocracy that hates America."
"Great idea, honey!"
