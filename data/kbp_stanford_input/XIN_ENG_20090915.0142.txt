KABUL, Sept. 15 (Xinhua)
Rockets fired by militants in Khost province in east of Afghanistan wounded two
children and caused panic among the locals on Tuesday, police said.
"Some 10 rockets fired by Taliban rebels in Sabari district Tuesday, one of
which struck a house injuring two innocent children," district police chief
Rasoul Marjan told Xinhua. Taliban insurgents have speed up attacks.
Conflicts and Taliban-linked insurgency, according to UN report released
recently, had claimed more than 1000 civilian lives until June, which means a 24
percent increase compared with the same period last year.
