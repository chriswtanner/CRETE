Palestinian shot dead at Gaza border protest: medics
Gaza City, April 28, 2010 (AFP)
A 20-year-old Palestinian was killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli fire on
Wednesday during a protest near the heavily guarded border fence, local medics
said.
Ahmed Salim, 20, was taken to Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital after being shot in the
thigh and died shortly after arrival, according to Muawiya Hassanein, the head
of Gaza emergency services.
The Israeli military would not immediately comment.
Witnesses, including an AFP correspondent, said Salim was with a group of a few
dozen Palestinian youths hurling rocks at Israeli troops stationed along the
border during a weekly protest attended by a few hundred people.
In recent weeks Gazans have begun holding weekly demonstrations against the
buffer zone that extends more than 300 metres (yards) from the Israeli security
fence. The demonstrations are modeled on similar actions in the West Bank.
Israel insists it only fires warning shots during the protests to keep people
out of what it views as a restricted military area, but several people have been
wounded since the start of the demonstrations.
The military says the buffer zone is necessary to prevent militant attacks along
the border of the territory ruled by the Islamist Hamas movement.
