Convicted bomb plotter seeks release in UK
LONDON 2010-11-25 13:34:25 UTC
A Jordanian man convicted in 1986 of attempting to blow up an Israeli airliner is asking a British court to order his release from prison.
Nezar Hindawi was convicted of packing explosives in the luggage of his pregnant Irish fiancee, who was traveling to Tel Aviv on El-Al. She was unaware of his plot, which was detected before the flight departed.
Hindawi was sentenced to 45 years in prison, said to the be the longest sentence ever set by an English court. He became eligible for parole in 2001, but the government rejected a subsequent recommendation from the Parole Board that Hindawi be released.
The hearing on his case began Thursday and is expected to continue through Friday.
