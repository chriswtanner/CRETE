hello,
looking to buy a new tumble dryer as our old one has just given up the ghost.
anyone recommend one - has to be silver and can either be vented or condensor.
seems that indesit and hotpoint do them but have heard bad things about both brands
anyone?
Suggest you go to the Currys website and look up preferred models, you can search by manufacturer and there is a section called REVOO for all the items listed where white goods are ranked according to their rating by customers, also you can read comment by other owners.
indesit and hotpoint are part of the same group...
Yes, Indesit (and Ariston) bought out Hotpoint a few years back now, and merged the two companies. Everything is made in the same factories, although of course with different brand names.
So you'd consider a brand you believe to be bad just so you can get in in silver?
I'm sure the majority of manufacturers offer them in more than white these days.
