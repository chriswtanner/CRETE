This country needs to be tougher on scum.
By this. I'm not putting everyone in here. But in Hartlepool and ambulance was taken for a joyride while a patient was being treated... Absolutely abysmal behavior.. My solution..
Deport them. We dont need them.
Opinions.

Make them fight. Send them to iraq rather than innocent good people getting killed put those scumbags in the firing line.
Deport them where ?
Middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

All the troops have pulled out of Iraq. Its been a while now.
Deport them where ?
Is that not what the justice system is for? Of your high horse, everyone does regretful things and everyone deserves to redeem themselves by serving a term in prison or receiving a fine and learning from their mistakes.
I agree with you that it needs to be much tougher on criminals however it will never happen. The politians obviously don't care enough about crime aslong as it doesn't affect them and the public isn't going crazy about it either so they have not got much incentive to change anything. And when one group of people fights for tougher punishment there will always be others who want smaller punishments for criminals. In the end the best thing you can do, is do your best to try and avoid crime and when crime specificaly comes to you... Unlucky mate.
Oh and sending them to the army has been proved to be a bad idea in like 100 other threads.
Deport them where ?
To european countries then see if they complain about our liberal use of the ECHR.

Give over. These type of people don't deserve justice.. If your gonna do things like that you don't deserve a chance. They wont change.
We need to cut all this crap now otherwise face a generation of chav's raising more chavs..
This county just needs to toughen up on these parasites to society. The stocks need to be re-introduced, and public humiliation! Get them out on the streets where good citizens can show them what they think of the little scumbags

If they are your citizens I think you will have to 'incentivize' them to go to Europe rather than deporting them.

I say, let's not even waste money deporting them. Just kick them into some uninhabited Scottish island.
Wow, what a bunch of pricks.

Both these could work.

You're wrong. We've never deported people from joyriding ambulances, so the reason we have a generation of chavs is not because of the justice system. It's because of poor education and poor rehabilitation of criminals.
