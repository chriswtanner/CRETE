A group protesting against same-sex marriage at the corner of College Avenue and Allen Street skipped town earlier Monday afternoon after an impromptu counter protest by members of the LGBTA Student Resource Center took over the end of Pattee Mall.
Members of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property played bagpipes and chanted against same-sex marriage for several hours, before equal rights supporters showed up with signs and silly string to drown them out.
Kristin Bauman (junior-dance) was eating lunch in the Corner Room, 100 W. College Ave., when she saw the protest across the street. Bauman said she began to run some errands before realizing she should be protesting as well.

The TFP is an organization of Catholics concerned about the moral crisis shaking the remnants of Christian civilization, according to the groups website. John Ritchie, director of student action for TFP, said the group came to State College to defend the institution of marriage.

The TFP ended its protest within an hour of Bauman beginning the counter protest.

4. Oh, them -- the people who keep claiming they're not fascists They're widely described as "ultra-reactionaries," but they insist that wanting to go back to the Middle Ages doesn't make them fascists. They do seem to pal around with fascists, though.
