BUCHAREST, Romania 2009-11-06 10:23:08 UTC
Romania's president has nominated a Bucharest district mayor as the country's new prime minister.
Liviu Negoita, who lead's the capital's sector 3, said Friday he will form a team in three days to present to parliament. He says he wants a government with broad political support.
Negoita belongs to the Democratic Liberal Party, which President Traian Basescu used to lead.
It was not clear whether he had enough support to be confirmed. This week lawmakers rejected a Basescu-nominated government led by finance adviser Lucian Croitoru.
Romania has been without a proper government since Oct. 13 when parliament dismissed Prime Minister Emil Boc in a no confidence vote.
