France deports radical imam to Egypt
PARIS, Jan 7, 2010 (AFP)
France on Thursday deported to Egypt a radical imam who for months had been
inciting followers in Paris area mosques to rise up against the West, the
government said.
Described as dangerous, Ali Ibrahim Al-Sudani was detained and sent back to
Egypt under an emergency deportation order, Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux
said in a statement.
"The secret services had identified this dangerous individual who for the past
months had been delivering sermons calling for a fight against the West in
several mosques in the Seine-Saint-Denis area," said Hortefeux in a statement.
Sudani showed "contempt for our society's values and incited violence," he
added.
The man was the 29th imam or Islamic preacher to have been deported from France
since 2001, according to the interior ministry.
In all, 129 Islamic radicals have been expelled from French territory, it added.
