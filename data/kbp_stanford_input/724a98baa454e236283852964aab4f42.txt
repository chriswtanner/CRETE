rumors are circulating that Lt Gov Ard might be t-Ard-y for work soon.
A little background on his legal troubles:
The women, Cindy McAllister and her daughter, Kristen Mayer both gave $3,500 a piece, according to Lt. Gov. Ard's ethics forms. The pair lists an address at Mallard Rd., but the contact information on the ethics form doesn't check out.
A man by the name of Bryan McAllister lives at that address. MCallister says neither woman has lived there in years. Bryan said he has been divorced from Cindy for at least 4 years.
Bryan told WIS he's never met the lieutenant governor and never gave money to his campaign. He also doesn't know his ex-wife's connection to Lt. Gov. Ard, or that she was ever that interested in politics. He wonders how Cindy or Mayer could afford to hand the lieutenant governor $7,000 considering their financial situations, "I don't see how, but then, you know, that's none of my business," Bryan continued, "But still, I don't see how."

Â“@AGAlanWilson inv into @KenArdSC reaches its 230th day. At least 4 state grand jury sessions, and still no word on case.
1. And another one bites the dust!
2. I wouldn't get your hopes up. He is a repub after all. I don't think he is resigning. Most likely announcing he is going to run for governor this election or perhaps AG. being the AG is a good way to get the investigation quashed.
3. wow Nothing shocks me as much as this. Ard resigned today. Repubs don't resign for any reason. Of course the resignation came AFTER he was found guilty of 92 campaign finance violations.
Will the press conference today at 1PM be a send off to Ard or announcement of charges? I expect his resignation was in exchange for no charges will be brought against him.
4. Good bye. Good riddance. Hopefully, our incompetent, corrupt governor will follow his example.
5. They've only just begun From gritsaregroceries in another thread:
The only reason most people think McConnell would make this move is because he thinks Haley won't survive until the end of her term.
It sure looks that way to me.
In the meantime It was announced that 7 charges have been levied against Ard. All misdemeanors.
"These donations to Mr. Ard's campaign were not a genuine demonstration of financial support," Wilson said. "Instead, they represented cash in the amount of $75,000 which was funneled from Mr. Ard to others and ultimately back to his campaign as purported contributions from citizens in the community."
"The funneled and phantom contributions, were certified to the State Ethics Commission and reported to the public at large as true and correct," Wilson said. "They were not true and correct. Campaign transparency was in reality campaign deceit."
He then used some of that money to pay for personal expenses.
6. It was a plea deal Some comments in local news sites are crap like 'well, unlike Democrats he took responsibility for what he did and resigned.' BS!! He pled and was given a $5,000 fine, 5 years probation and 300 hours community service. Otherwise, had he tried to hold onto his office and fight it, he was facing 5 years in jail if he lost.
7. Out of 95 ethics charges, there had to be a heck of a lot more than 7 crimes he commited. So even those were reduced. IMO. Good ole boy system needs to go. Yes, the dems are worse meme. I am so sick of hearing that. The people in this state could not fathom that this state is RUN by repubs who would throw the book at a dem for much, much less.
8. IOKALAYAR It's OK As Long As You're A Republican. It's funny how Ard's cheerleaders have been saying, "Don't pay it no mind, he has trouble managing all those little details." Right. 'Little details' like following the law. He was laundering money, for pete's sake.
