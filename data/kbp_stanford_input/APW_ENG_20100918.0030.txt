The aunt of an American woman released from Iran this week after more than a year in prison says her niece is preparing to return to the U.S. and plans to hold at a news conference in New York.
Sarah Shourd's aunt, Karen Sandys, told The Associated Press on Friday that Shourd and her mother will travel from Oman to New York on Saturday.
Family spokeswoman Samantha Topping says Shourd and her mom will speak to reporters at a New York hotel at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) Sunday.
Sandys says Shourd is happy to be free and is focused on securing the freedom of her friends, Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer.
The three University of California, Berkeley graduates were arrested and imprisoned by Iran in July 2009.
