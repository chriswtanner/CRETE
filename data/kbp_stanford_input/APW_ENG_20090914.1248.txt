Judge: King children to meet to discuss estate
ATLANTA 2009-09-14 21:46:32 UTC
A judge has ordered the surviving children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King to hold a shareholder's meeting to discuss their father's estate.
The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother, Dexter King, last year to force him to open the books of their father's estate. The lawsuit claimed Dexter King, the estate's administrator, has refused to provide documents concerning the estate's operations.
The three siblings are the sole shareholders, directors and officers of a company that manages their father's intellectual property, but they have not met for an annual shareholder's meeting since 2004.
Dexter King has also sued his sister, who administers their mother's estate.
