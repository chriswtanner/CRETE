Peedo with a twist
A public school mistress, who was "pressured" into a lesbian affair by a 15-year-old pupil, wept as she was jailed for 15 months
Music teacher Helen Goddard - nicknamed " the jazz lady" - befriended the youngster as they met for coffee after lessons.
Their relationship eventually became sexual, a development the youngster's parents scathingly condemned as a "complete betrayal" of trust.
London's Southwark Crown Court heard that the five-month affair included an overnight stay at her home and a romantic weekend in Paris. Their forbidden trysts remained a secret until the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, received an anonymous tip-off about what was happening. Care workers were immediately contacted and police alerted.
When officers raided the teacher's housing estate maisonette in Thornham Street, Greenwich, south east London, they arrested the 26-year-old and seized various sex toys including vibrators and "fluffy handcuffs".
Goddard, a former child music prodigy, admitted six sample counts of sexual activity with the girl between February and July this year.
The disgraced teacher, wearing a white blouse and a black waistcoat and trousers bowed her head and repeatedly wiped tears from her eyes as Judge Anthony Pitts said: "This is a difficult case. The evidence showed you were having a full-on sexual relationship with the girl for many months. She has made it clear that the sexual contact between you was consensual and she says in her statement that in fact it was instigated by her.
"It is, of course, against the law to engage in sexual activity with a person under 16, even with her consent. These are serious offences in their own right. But the particularly aggravating feature evident here of course is that you were her music teacher throughout this period and from well before the sexual relationship started."
That meant a relationship such as theirs remained illegal until after the girl turned 18.
The judge said it was clear from the character references he had received that Goddard had been a "big hit" with her pupils. One of her former colleagues, noticing girls "flocking to her room at break times", said she even warned her of the "dangers of being over-friendly and too popular
Nicknamed jazz lady huh,, there are other names for people like her,,,,,like peedo idiot brain

Perchance did you miss the term "lesbian"? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/tongue.gif"/>
Or have you undergone a "transformation" in your personality post your school years? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>
Wow, that was an easy one <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> )

actually this would be rather a case of ephebophilia instead of pedophilia. To be pedophil a person must be attracted to a child before it entered puberty. I.E. the things that normal person would find sexually attractive (like developed breasts) are still missing. A person with ephebophilia on the other hand is attracted to minors as well, but to those who are in puberty. Let me use an example:
a (textbook) pedophile is attracted to a five year old, but not to a fifteen year old.
a (textbook) ephebophile is attracted to a fifteen year old, but not a five year old.
(None of this is meant to defend anything, but simply to clarify the right meaning of the term. Rape and murder for example are two different things as well, but that does not mean that one is better then the other)

You have to be careful with girls of today, the vast majority of girls who are 14, 15 or 16look a lot older trhan they are. When I was at school I had a little fling with my art teacher, never got as far as S** though, mores the pity.

Something similar, I kept my mouth shut, she could've lost her job or worse. Learned a thing or two. I can definitely say I was NOT being taken advantage of or being exploited. The foibles of youth. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/>
