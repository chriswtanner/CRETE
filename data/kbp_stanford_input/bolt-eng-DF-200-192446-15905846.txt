Bear Grylls Fired :(
There goes the "better drink my own piss" meme <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>
He'll get a new show at a different network soon most likely.
He was a fake anyway so I give no ****.
He's the Chief Scout leader and he drinks his own piss?
Care, I do not.
Care, I do not.
I dont care either, but Ill admit I loved his show a lot
He's the Chief Scout leader and he drinks his own piss ?
Exactly; it's his own.
I'd like to see him on the food network soon.
Got fired.
Better drink my own piss.
Don't really care about this thread probs nothin but a troll trying to get his limelight by delivery the latest news on this site. Yeah he has been fired so what.
If you don't care about this thread then don't post. It's quite simple really.
Learn the meaning of "troll" before you use it in a sentence.

No way.
I &lt;3'd his shows <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> !
I read the title as 'Bear Grylls Fried :(' for some reason. I thought he might have got lost in the Sahara Desert and run out of urine to drink or something. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/dontknow.gif" alt=":dontknow:"/>

Awww what <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> I read the article but still dont get why he was fired <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>
And why does everyone keep referring to him drinking his own urine?? Its funny as hell but give the guy a break - he just lost his job <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>
Most of the "stunts" were fake anyway.
"In 2008, he apologised for misleading viewers for an episode which saw him supposedly abandoned in the wilderness - a programme consultant later claimed he had stayed in a motel."
How was anyone dumb enough to believe the rubbish he says about being lost etc anyway.
This is what happens when people believe everything they are told by the media.
Ah well at least we have Ben Fogal <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/awesome.gif" alt=":awesome:"/>
