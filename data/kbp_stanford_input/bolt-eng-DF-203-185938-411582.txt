This Costa cruise ship accident is crazy!
How could anyone on the ship's bridge not realize they were only 600 ft from land with or without radar?????!!!
We just came home from a cruise on Carnival and when we were in Roatan (Honduras) the captain on a Costa Ship (Atlantica) took 2 hours to moor up at the pier... which made us have to wait to moor up too (takes about 15 mins normally). Our captain sent over a message to say he would tender over and moor up for him but the request was denied. Anyway, makes me wonder about the competency of the Costa captains.
There was some major drugs and/or alcohol involved in that mess. Omgwtf?!
MSN is reporting that the captain has been arrested on multi[le charges of manslaughter.
I know, this is really sad. It's scary to think of somebody so reckless having so many innocent lives in his hands.

Oh damn.
ugh!
She said an Argentine couple handed her their three-year-old daughter, as they were unable to keep their balance. ‘I grabbed the baby. But then I was being pushed down,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want the baby to fall down the stairs. I gave the baby back. I couldn’t hold her. I thought that was the end and I thought they should be with their baby. I wonder where they are.’
holyshit

That statement made me sick. I didn't want the baby to fall down the stairs, instead I'd rather she drown with her parents.
Awesome.

Someone is both thoughtless and *really* picky about analogies. "It wasn't the exact same ship that sank in the same water, soooo"
ugh!

I read it as "fall down the stairs to her death with us, or stay with the parents and they drown together" Like they didn't have a choice - either way was death - either with strangers or with her parents.
Horrific. Absolutely horrific.
I simply cannot imagine and hope to never face something similar.
This sounds horrifying. I hope those parents and that child lived. I'm just reading the story now here:
Chilling. I can only imagine what that fear would have been like.
