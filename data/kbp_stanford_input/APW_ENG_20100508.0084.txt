KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2010-05-08 03:24:50 UTC
A Malaysian court has sentenced an Indonesian man to death for fatally shooting five people during a wedding reception on remote Borneo island.
The national news agency Bernama reported Saturday that the court in Sarawak state sentenced Nyambang Entuhan on Friday to death by hanging over the 2007 shooting.
The man, who is married to a local woman, reportedly became angry and opened fire after the village chief warned wedding guests not to marry Indonesians. The bride and groom survived.
The report said he was also sentenced to 22 years in prison for wounding nine others and illegal firearm possession. His lawyer has said he would appeal.
Officials could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday.
