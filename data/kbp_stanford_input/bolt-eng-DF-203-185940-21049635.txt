wedding gift question
My H and I are friends with a couple who are having a destination wedding later this year. They are also having a local reception a few weeks after that. We have known them about 2 years and talk/see each other about once every few months. My H is very good friends with the guy's BIL. I was surprised that we received the save the date in the mail for the destination wedding. My question is: if we can't make it to the destination wedding, but go to the local reception, do we give 2 gifts? We may make it to the destination wedding if we receive an invite and I think it would be proper etiquette to give 2 gifts in that case. wdyt?
One wedding = one gift (even if there are two parties)

Agreed.

<img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-21.gif" alt="Yes"/> You are acknowledging the life event of the wedding not the parties. And I bet they would be very grateful if you had it delivered to their home and didn't bring it with you to the destination wedding (unless it is a check).

Ditto 100%. Just because they are going overboard on the parties doesn't mean you have to give them double the gifts.
And my feeling on attending a destination wedding is that your presence is their gift since it costs a pretty penny to go to those.

Yup. A wedding never ever means 2 gifts.
One present.
