Question about Dave Ramsey program
One of the things I keep hearing (I have been listening to his podcasts), is he tells a lot of people to sell things to get out of debt, and if they have an expensive car they owe money one, he says sell it and buy a beater car. Now what if you owe more than your car is worth and it is one of the biggest debts, what would you suggest? Just keep it and make the monthly payments? I guess there really isn't much else you can do, right?
For me, it is my biggest debt and would be the last to pay off if I follow his method of paying off the smallest debts first. So I am thinking I just don't worry about it, even though the payment is killing me...
If I recall, he suggests selling it anyway and paying the difference. That way, you are completely finished with the car payment, are only out the difference (instead of the entire amount left that is owed), and have purchased something cheap in cash.
For us, we just worked the car into the Debt Snowball. We had bought the car after my son was born and I refused (stubbornly) to sell it and by a p.o.s. We just kept up with the Debt Snowball and we are now on track to pay off the car 6 months early.
How does the interest rate compare to those of your other debts? It is better to snowball from highest interest rate to lowest, not based on the balance.

The interest rate is 3.9% on the car. The problem is that I just bought it in May, and if I did sell and pay the difference I don't have enough cash on hand to do that, so my best bet might be to just include it in the snowball.
The other credit cards I need to pay off range from 3% to 13% so they aren't terrible, just high balances and total about $30K
I have heard him say to keep the car in that situation IF you will have it paid off within 18 months. If not, he says it is too much car for your income. How much do you owe on the car and how much is it worth? If you owe $30,000 and you're upside down by $5K, he'd probably say that you should get a $5K car and owe $10K...and you've just cut your debt by $20,000.

You can't do that. You can't buy a 5k car and finance it for 10k, and you can't continue to owe 5k on the car you don't have anymore.

I owe a lot, close to 40k, not sure how much it is worth. It's a 2011 BMW x3. I didn't put much of a downpayment, which is why I am upside down still. My income is pretty good, I just live in a HCOL area, so my actual living expenses are on the higher end.
