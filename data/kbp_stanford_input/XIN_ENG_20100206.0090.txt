Cypriot TV presenter charged with hiring hitmen to kill boss
NICOSIA, Jan. 6 (Xinhua)
A Cypriot woman television presenter has been charged with murdering her former
employer as details of the case were revealed on Saturday by local media.
Elena Scordeli, 42, was among three people charged with the murder of Andis
Hadjicostis, former managing director of Dias media group, which owns Sigma
television channel, radio stations and several magazines.
He was shot twice by a man with a sawn off shotgun on January 11 as he was about
to enter his house in Nicosia.
The other two accused are Elena's brother, who is alleged to be the man who
arranged a meeting with the killers, and the man who is believed by police to
have made the arrangements for the murder.
The man who actually fired the shots left Cyprus immediately after the murder
and is still at large.
Daily Politis published on Saturday a statement by a man who admitted he had
driven the hitman away from the scene of the murder. He has turned police
witness and was not accused.
He said that Elena Scordeli met the hit men and promised to pay 50,000 euros
(68,170 U.S. dollars) to each one of them, if they killed Hadjicostis.
"I want this man to die," he claimed Elena told them.
He also claimed that her brother told them she wanted him dead because he had
fired her from her job as the hostess of a chat program, despite the fact that
she owned 20 percent of the stock of Sigma TV.
She is also alleged to have promised them employment for life on Sigma TV,
saying her brother would become the managing director after the death of
Hadjicostis.
The police witness said in his statement they monitored the movements of
Hadjicostis for several days. He added that, before his murder, they came very
near to shooting by mistake another man who came out of the television station
building at night.
