In fact, Peter Bossman, a Ghana-born physician, could be the first black mayor elected anywhere in his region of southern Europe.
Bossman, who settled in this tiny Alpine nation in the 1970s to study medicine in what was then known as Yugoslavia, won a runoff election in Piran on Sunday with 51.4 percent of votes.
The 54-year-old candidate is a member of Slovenia's governing Social Democrats. He runs a private practice and was previously a member of the Piran City Council.
Following the vote, Bossman said he is "happy and proud."
Slovenia, located near Italy, Austria and Croatia, is a member of European Union and NATO.
