DPJ plenary meeting approves Ozawa as party secretary general
TOKYO, Sept. 15 (Xinhua)
The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) convened a plenary meeting Tuesday, formally
approving acting President Ichiro Ozawa as the party's new secretary general.
"As secretary general, I'm resolved to do my best with all my power to fulfill
my duty," said Ozawa at the joint plenary meeting of DPJ lawmakers from both
lower and upper houses.
The former party leader, who stepped down on May 11 due to the indictment of his
top secretary in the Nishimastsu political funds scandal, will act as the new
No. 2 party executive and take charge of day-to-day party affairs and elections.
Ozawa, 66, became the chief of the DPJ in April 2006 when Seiji Maehara stepped
down over a faked e-mail message scandal. He was elected as president of the DPJ
in September 2006 after serving out Maehara's term.
