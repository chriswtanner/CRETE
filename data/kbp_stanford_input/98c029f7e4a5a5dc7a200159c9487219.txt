NEW YORK  A gay teacher fired from a Catholic school in the St. Louis suburb of Normandy after church officials learned he was planning to get married has tied the knot in a ceremony in New York.
Al Fischer lost his job in February after an official with the Archdiocese of St. Louis overheard him telling co-workers about his plans to wed his partner of 20 years. He had been a music teacher at the St. Ann Catholic School in Normandy.
The New York Times reported that Fischer and his partner, Charlie Robin, were married in a ceremony in front of a fountain in Central Park.
New York legalized same-sex marriage last year. Missouri still doesnt allow it.
Best of luck to the newlyweds.
