Amabassador visits French researcher in Tehran prison
PARIS, Aug 14, 2009 (AFP)
France's ambassador to Iran on Friday visited a young French academic in the
Tehran prison where she is being held on spying charges, the foreign ministry
said here.
"He explained to her that the French authorities are doing all they can to
obtain her release as soon as possible," a spokesman said.
The visit was ambassador Bernard Poletti's second trip to Evin prison to see
Clotide Reiss, who was among at least 110 defendants tried last week on charges
related to huge post-election protests across Iran.
President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said the French leader had met with Reiss's
father, but gave no details of the meeting.
Remi Reiss said Thursday that Iranian officials may release his 24-year-old
daughter on bail so that she could live in the French embassy while she awaits
the verdict of her trial.
She was accused of spying and taking part in a Western plot to destabilise the
government of the Islamic republic, apparently because she attended a street
protest and emailed a picture to a friend.
Securing Reiss' release has been a diplomatic priority for France, with
President Nicolas Sarkozy raising the case with other leaders including Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad who intervened on his behalf with Tehran.
