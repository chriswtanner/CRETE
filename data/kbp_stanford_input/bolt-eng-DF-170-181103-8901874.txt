Administration to propose steps on gun safety
WASHINGTON (AP)  Six months after Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot, the White House is preparing to propose some new steps on gun safety, though they're likely to fall short of the bold measures activists would like to see.
Anti-gun groups have been disappointed to see no action so far from President Barack Obama, who supported tough gun control measures earlier in his career but fell largely silent upon becoming president. Some activists were using the opportunity of the six-month anniversary of the Giffords shooting on Friday to speak up.
Spokesman Jay Carney said that the new steps would be made public "in the near future." He didn't offer details, but people involved in talks at the Justice Department to craft the new measures said they expected to see something in the next several weeks. Whatever is proposed is not expected to involve legislation or take on major issues like banning assault weapons but could include executive action to strengthen the background check system or other steps.

"To prevent the next Tucson, we need a comprehensive background check system, which is what the president called for in April," said the director of the mayors' group, Mark Glaze. "That said, there are many steps the president can take on his own authority, without new laws, that could make a very real difference."
Everyone knows that if gun laws are just strict enough, criminals will start obeying them.
Well, if they do ban AR's it'll just drive up the value of my current collection, lol!!!
The fact of the matter is that gun rights have only increased under the Obama Administration, not decreased. Much to the disappointment of the NRA among others.
This season, the group has sponsored print and video advertisements opposing Obama; anti-Obama independent expenditures by the NRA this cycle total $1.8 million, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
But of course:
WASHINGTON  More than two months after the Tucson shootings, the administration is calling together both the gun lobby and gun safety groups to find common ground. But President Obama has no plans to take the lead in proposing further gun control legislation, aides say, and the nations major gun rights group is snubbing the invitation.

i remember Pelosi wouldn't even LOOK at gun control legislation.
Gun Safety: Don't point your weapon at another human unless necessary.
Off subject a bit. Its too bad that guy that was killed in Yellowstone, by that grizzly, wasn't carrying at least a.45 with a 15 round mag the other day.
Well thank god, that will surely create lots of jobs. Finally were focusing on the things that need our attention.
i remember Pelosi wouldn't even LOOK at gun control legislation.
The idea that the Democrats are going to try and ban guns is becoming more and more of a far-fetched fantasy. Especially when Liberals like myself support the rights of gun owners and are only looking to see reasonable regulation. Not outright banning.

There's plenty of reasonable regulation out there. We don't need more, just enforce the 10,000 pages that are already law.

"Reasonable" is a relative term, isn't it?
"Reasonable" is a relative term, isn't it?
It depends. What do you think? Should we have no regulation whatsoever?
should convicted felons be allowed to buy guns?
should convicted felons be allowed to buy guns?
I'd like to say yes, but probably not.
should convicted felons be allowed to buy guns?
It depends. Are we talking about violent convicted felons or non-violent?

In other words, enforce existing laws.
Anything else would be constitutionally problematic and political folly.

Didn't say that, did I?
LBT nailed it. Enforce what's on the books now. Quit pandering by making more laws that replicate existing ones.

And there is your ignorance, you and your buddies "reasonable regulations" are anything but.
should convicted felons be allowed to buy guns?
I would say it would depend on what the conviction was for.

Sounds a lot like what I said:

Though according to RGS, I'm not a reasonable fellow. But I wonder if that makes you my 'buddy' and unreasonable by proxy? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_think.gif"/>

Not too worried about what he thinks. However, what would you define as "reasonable"?

That's a very broad question to ask.
However, I can tell you for example that I don't believe violent felons should be allowed to carry guns. Non-violent felons I do believe should still be allowed to carry guns.

I disagree.
A felony is a felony and an indicator of someone that has no respect for the law. Therefore they won't care much for any gun laws and will carry them if they wish.

Wouldn't the breaking of any law be an indicator of someone that has no respect for the law?

Felony is representative of the severity of that breach, isn't it?
It's not like it's a surprise to any felon.
It's common knowledge that if you do "this", "this" will happen.
You know going in that a felony disqualifies you for gun ownership.
Don't do the crime.

So what if someone commits like five counts of the same crime but they're not felonies?

What if my unicorn farts rainbows?
As was previously stated, we have more than enough established gun laws to follow without creating new ones.
As far as I know there is no limit to the number of misdemeanors.
Though there is the special circumstance of a Domestic Violence charge, not even a conviction, that will disqualify one form purchasing a handgun.

I could support this:
No gun purchases for violent felons, and three strikes for non-violent felons. Get convicted the three non-violent felonies, and lose your gun rights.
I don't see how this administration is going to do anything against "guns" at this point. They are fast retreat over stimulus funds being used for a "supposed" tracing program of guns into Mexico. It looks like Holder might be implicated in this mess that has resulted in the deaths of American and Mexican law enforcement. If Holder doesn't take the hit, his boss, Obama may be an impeachment consideration. It is funny how the left were all over the Iran/Contra affair. In this case the feds just let them have the guns for seemingly, political purposes, hoping for a catastrophie where they could hammer down on the 2nd, but something went wrong, and now, they are in full CYA mode. Where are all the dems, denouncing this?

Silly -- it's okay when a Democrat does it.
