LINCOLN (AP) Â— The Nebraska Supreme Court has halted an appeal involving a co-op employee who suffered a traumatic brain injury when he fell off a truck's flatbed.
The court dismissed an appeal by the Aurora Cooperative in a ruling Friday and sent the case back to a workers' compensation court.
John Jacobitz of Milligan was injured in August 2010 while cleaning up after a customer appreciation supper. Court records say Jacobitz dropped off a grill in a company shed and was riding back to the event location when he fell off.
A judge ruled that Jacobitz was acting within the scope of his duties when the accident occurred, but had not yet determined his benefits. The high court ruled that the co-op filed its appeal too early.
