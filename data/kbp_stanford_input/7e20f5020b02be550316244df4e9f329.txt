1. Yawn. two assholes who got married are getting divorced....
2. I like Johnny Weir. I don't think it is necessary to call them assholes.
3. From greatest moment of his life to divorce in 3 years or less. Not unlike a lot of straight couples really. I don't know if lifelong monogamy was ever a truly realistic ideal, but it certainly isn't now.
4. Good gawd...who gives a crap. Idiots...just saw this on MSN.com...stupid.
