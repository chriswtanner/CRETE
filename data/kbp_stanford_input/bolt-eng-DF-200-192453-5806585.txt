I don't know how the rest of you feel but I'm sick of seeing Prejudice/Racist/Lowerclass/Upperclass threads.
Whether they do right or wrong people are people at the end of the day regardless of their skin colour, faith, the area they grew up in or where their parents are from.
I'm not racist or prejudice and try not to be judgemental. I'm proud of my upbringing and my heritage. I've got open accepting parents who ensured we could see people for who they are, good or bad regardless of other factors.
People are people X
agree 100%
Thank you, let's hope the majority do :-) Otherwise I'm in for it haha
Obviously I agree with judging people as inderviduals regardless of class, race... I mean, everyone does!
But with things like the riots in London, it is naiive to believe that inderviduals are doing it for the fun of it, and take things at face-value. We need to understand the causes behind violence if we are to face them and help move the country forward.

This is the thing though, not everybody does.
I totally agree with you on this and with all the police cuts things may become harder to manage (but that's another subject haha)
But my point is that on a site like this it's a shame to see so many people that seem to take a dislike to people because of the simplest of things.
Please stop making excuses for these behaviours by playing the race card.
It is a fact that blacks have done this to a much wider extent than whites thus far, in instigating and leading it, even if white chavs (by sheer numbers) are starting to join in at a tiny rate too.
There are loads and loads of poor East Asians, Indians and poor East Europeans who had *nothing* and didn't even know the language and did much better. Blacks in Britain are overwhelmingly born here, they know the culture and have free health care, education etc etc.
There are no excuses whatsoever. What has happened is disgraceful and what's more: it is alarming. Is this what will happen in a time of crisis, people will ask, instead of uniting the multicultural dream will become a looting, rioting and violent nightmare.

This thread has NOTHING to do with the riots! Look at when I put it up and it was in reference to other threads/posts on here.
But as you're on it.....
"Blacks" alone are not to blame. People are people! It just so happened that where is started, there are a lot of black people. Its relative to the area. Ie, Asian people in B'ham, caucasian in Manchester etc etc.
I have black family in London who are peaceful, work hard and play a big part in their community. I have some White family in other areas who are layabouts, in and out of prison and are out for benefits they can get :-//
