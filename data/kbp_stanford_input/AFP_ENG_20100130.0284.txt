Iran hangs two convicted rapists: report
Tehran, Jan 30, 2010 (AFP)
Iran hanged on Saturday two men convicted of raping a woman in front of her
husband and child, the ISNA news agency reported.
The hangings were carried out in the capital's notorious Evin prison, the report
said.
The men identified by their first names, Masoud and Mohammad, had broken into a
house last November in the northern town of Lavasan and raped the woman, the
report said.
The latest hangings bring to at least 14 the number of people executed in Iran
so far in 2010, according to an AFP count based on news reports. Last year at
least 270 people were hanged.
Tehran says the death penalty is necessary for maintaining public security and
is applied only after exhaustive judicial proceedings.
Murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are all punishable by
death in the Islamic republic.
