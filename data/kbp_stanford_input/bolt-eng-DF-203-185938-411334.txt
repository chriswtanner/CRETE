My MIL is on my shitlist. Care to hear this?
I've never been this irked before, but her effing weirdness has gotten to my limit,
I usually pass off her stupidity on that fact that she's extremely narrow minded and has lived a sheltered life. Doesn't know any better when it comes to social situations sometimes.
She says to me the other day... " So and So and i were talking the other day and we've never seen anyone with as bad pregnant brain as you have this time around."
Me: "why? What did I do?"
MIL: ignores question and just repeats the original comment about me having horrible pregnant brain, but with no examples.
This was me when it happened: <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-7.gif" alt="Tongue Tied"/> <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-10.gif" alt="Embarrassed"/>
This was me about an hour later thinking about it: <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-42.gif" alt="Confused"/> <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-43.gif" alt="Confused"/>
This is me two days later: <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry"/>
hahahah is it bad that I immediately think she
a) gave you 2 or 3 examples and you
b) forgot them as soon as she said them, you're pg brain in overdrive
c) then you drove to the store when you meant to go to your dd's school. hahahah
luvyoumissy
I'm sensitive, yo!
She's an effing MORON! WHO THE FLUCK SAYS THAT TO HER DIL????
fuckingweirdo!
/gavel!
hahaha
don't be so sensitive. the good thing about pg brain is you can forget all the nasty *** too. so totally forget to pick up your kids from her house for 2-3 hours on a sunday when you need a mani-pedi?
what? you have them? I thought they were in their rooms?
I've had issues with MIL but reading dumb sh!t like this makes her seem like a dream.
Sorry, she's sounds kinda like a b!tch.
My MIL would do this, except 'so and so' would be one of her imaginary friends, who also think she's fabulous and don't understand why we all don't appreciate her more.

"So and so" is really her daughter. (my SIL) <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-8.gif" alt="Indifferent"/>

Ugh! Sorry dude.
"well, I've tried to forget I'm related to you but so far, it hasnt worked. Guess my pg brain isn't that bad"
Ha, thia reminded me of mil when we were planning our wedding. They were moving into their new condo a few weeks before our shower. Everytime someone would mention our wedding, she would go on and on about the housewarming party that her friends were throwing for her. She wanted to go with us when we registerer. I thought it was strange but let her come. I had already set our registry up online so we got our gun and started zapping. She showed up a few minutes later with her own gun. She wanted to see eveything on our list so we didn't register for the same items. There was never a housewarming party.
"well, I've tried to forget I'm related to you but so far, it hasnt worked. Guess my pg brain isn't that bad"
You come up with the best comebacks! I can never think of this stuff on the spot, I always get all flustered and say something stupid.
Your mil is a ninny.
If she says it again, be sure to say "well I'm not so foggy that I don't remember the last time you insulted me like this. Thanks for nothing".
Or "So you've said before. " Frigid smile, walk off.
Or " you bittch". Finger given, door slammed in her face.
I suppose it all depends on the context of the situation. I'd pick one of these.
