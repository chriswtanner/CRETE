2 Border Patrol Agents: 12 years in Prison for wounding Illegal Alien Drug Smuggler
WHAT a crock of horseshit...I heard this on the radio this morning, and found this link:
Two U.S. Border Patrol agents were sentenced to prison terms of 11 years and 12 years for shooting a drug-smuggling suspect in the buttocks as he fled across the U.S.-Mexico border.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso, Texas, sentenced Jose Alonso Compean to 12 years in prison and Ignacio Ramos to 11 years and one day despite a plea by their attorney for a new trial after three jurors said they were coerced into voting guilty in the case, the Washington Times reported.
As WorldNetDaily reported, a federal jury convicted Compean, 28, and Ramos, 37, in March after a two-week trial on charges of causing serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence and a civil rights violation.
Ramos is an eight-year veteran of the U.S. Naval Reserve and a former nominee for Border Patrol Agent of the Year.
On Feb. 17, he responded to a request for back up from Compean, who noticed a suspicious van near the levee road along the Rio Grande River near the Texas town of Fabens, about 40 miles east of El Paso.
Ramos, who headed toward Fabens hoping to cut off the van, soon joined a third agent already in pursuit.
Behind the wheel of the van was an illegal alien, Osbaldo Aldrete-Davila of Mexico. Unknown to the growing number of Border Patrol agents converging on Fabens, Aldrete-Davila's van was carrying 800 pounds of marijuana.
Unable to outrun Ramos and the third agent, Aldrete-Davila stopped the van on the levee, jumped out and started running toward the river. When he reached the other side of the levee, he was met by Compean who had anticipated the smuggler's attempt to get back to Mexico.
"We both yelled out for him to stop, but he wouldn't stop, and he just kept running," Ramos told California's Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. Aldrete-Davila crossed a canal.
"At some point during the time where I'm crossing the canal, I hear shots being fired," Ramos said. "Later, I see Compean on the ground, but I keep running after the smuggler."
At that point, Ramos said, Aldrete-Davila turned toward him, pointing what looked like a gun.
"I shot," Ramos said. "But I didn't think he was hit, because he kept running into the brush and then disappeared into it. Later, we all watched as he jumped into a van waiting for him. He seemed fine. It didn't look like he had been hit at all."
The commotion and multiple calls for back up had brought seven other agents  including two supervisors  to the crossing by this time. Compean picked up his shell casings, but Ramos did not. He also did not follow agency procedure and report that he had fired his weapon.
"The supervisors knew that shots were fired," Ramos told the paper. "Since nobody was injured or hurt, we didn't file the report. That's the only thing I would've done different."
Had he done that one thing differently, it's unlikely it would have mattered to prosecutors.
More than two weeks after the incident,(emphasis mine) Christopher Sanchez, an investigator with the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, received a call from a Border Patrol agent in Wilcox, Ariz. The agent's mother-in-law had received a call from Aldrete-Davila's mother in Mexico telling her that her son had been wounded in the buttocks in the shooting.
Sanchez followed up with a call of his own to the smuggler in Mexico.
In a move that still confuses Ramos and Compean, the U.S. government filed charges against them after giving full immunity to Aldrete-Davila and paying for his medical treatment at an El Paso hospital.
At trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Kanof told the court that the agents had violated an unarmed Aldrete-Davila's civil rights.
"The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it is a violation of someone's Fourth Amendment rights to shoot them in the back while fleeing if you don't know who they are and/or if you don't know they have a weapon," said Kanof.
Kanof dismissed Ramos' testimony that he had seen something shiny in the smuggler's hand, saying that the agent couldn't be sure it was a gun he had seen.
Further, Kanof argued, it was a violation of Border Patrol policy for agents to pursue fleeing suspects.
"Agents are not allowed to pursue. In order to exceed the speed limit, you have to get supervisor approval, and they did not," she told the Daily Bulletin.
Those shell casings Compean picked up were described to the jury as destroying the crime scene and their failure to file an incident report  punishable by a five-day suspension, according to Border Patrol regulations  an attempted cover up.
The Texas jury came back with a guilty verdict. Conviction for discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence has an automatic 10-year sentence. The other counts have varying punishments.
"How are we supposed to follow the Border Patrol strategy of apprehending terrorists or drug smugglers if we are not supposed to pursue fleeing people?" said Ramos, who noted that he only did on that day what he had done for the previous 10 years. "Everybody who's breaking the law flees from us. What are we supposed to do? Do they want us to catch them or not?"
He also noted that none of the other agents who had responded to the incident filed reports that shots were fired and, besides, both supervisors at the scene knew they had discharged their weapons.
"You need to tell a supervisor because you can't assume that a supervisor knows about it," Kanof countered. "You have to report any discharge of a firearm."
"This is the greatest miscarriage of justice I have ever seen," said Andy Ramirez of the nonprofit group Friends of the Border Patrol. "This drug smuggler has fully contributed to the destruction of two brave agents and their families and has sent a very loud message to the other Border Patrol agents: If you confront a smuggler, this is what will happen to you."
The El Paso Sheriff's Department increased its patrols around the Ramos home when the family received threats from people they believed were associated with Aldrete-Davila.
Bewildering how ANYONE could bring these charges to begin with, much LESS hand down the ruling that this judge &amp; jury made. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/>

Unless you are a VIP, you have to actually be in prison before you would be considered for a pardon.

This will be appealed on these grounds and probably thrown out.
A Judge that would let this verdict stand should be impeached.
I guess when real border security is taken seriously then real border security can be achieved:nine:
saw this on Glenn Beck the other night. I have to have hope in the appeals process that these guys will never goto actually prison.
three jurors said they were coerced into voting guilty in the case
How were these jurors "coerced"? The drug cartels are obviously very powerful and dangerous. Who knows? maybe the judge was also "coerced"?

Most trackhoes can go to 20', well out of dog-sniffing range.
I say we set the Democrats on this.
They'll form a few committee's, request a billion or so to fund the investigations.
After two, or three years of various dog, and pony shows, they'll find the janitor of the local appeals court, has connections with the Mexican Mafia, on his mothers side. They'll deport him, and they'll issue a four thousand page report on what a great job they did, and how it was really just a terrible misunderstanding. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/huddle.gif"/>
Of course the boarder patrol officers will still be in jail.:talk2:

Dead On! "GWB.......it's cajones time!". Pardon those two border guards!!!!!!!
It's time to inundate the White House with letters/phone calls, of wrath about this injustice!!!!
The Justice Department threw these guys to the wolves, when they should have been acting on their behalf. It's a bullshit case that should have been thrown out of court.

Personally, i'd favor knee-capping the smuggler and dropping his sorry ass far out in the desert. Let the scavengers and carrion eaters deal with him.

Hollow-point from the back. Pretty much an amputation, wouldn't you agree?

Ya know, I am not sure if you are trolling, being sarcastic or exagerating your sentiment. If it is the latter, welll....dang....sign me up too!

I'm not trolling...I'm not being sarcastic...Maybe just exagerating a little. A ballpeen hammer would do nicely.

Beck made a good point - the agents get 12 years for this while Lynne Stewart gets 2 1/2 years for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/ap/2006/10/16/ap3095245.html">helping an imprisoned terrorist sheik communicate with his followers on the outside.</a>

And these guys should have been given a citation for doing more than their jobs, while she should have been given a life sentence. She knew it, which is why she celebrated the sentencing.
Bush "could have" said something about this case, and maybe imposed some influence. But NOOOOOoooooo. Bush is in some kind of sick fucking LOVE fest with mexico, and all for protecting illegal aliens. Bush should be tried for treason for the way he's ignored the tidal wave of illegal mexican invaders into our country, and then wanting to give them all a free pass, better known as "amnesty".
The border patrol agents should have been given meritorious service medals and sent back out on patrol. I hope their case is appealed and they win.

I agree. At this point he should pardon them, not wait unti 2008 like Clinton.

Pardon them now! I agree......not at the eleventh hour of your Presidency as William Jefferson Clinton did.
By the way, some of the folks that Clinton pardoned were the scum of society.............He totally abused his pardoning powers as President.

I don't think he can pardon them until they've been in jail for a year or so, at least, traditionally that's been the policy, at least until Clinton got involved. But that was different, since he got several blow jobs from Rich's ex in return.

What happened to Constitutional rights for foreign born people that would cause harm in or to the U.S.?
