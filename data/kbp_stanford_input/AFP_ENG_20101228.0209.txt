MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, Dec 28, 2010 (AFP)
A barrage of US missile strikes killed at least 15 militants in Pakistan's North
Waziristan tribal district on Tuesday, obliterating compounds and vehicles used
by fighters, officials said.
Pakistani security officials said the first strike destroyed two compounds and
killed five rebels in Ghulam Khan village, 20 kilometres (13 miles) east of
Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan.
They said further strikes carried out by unmanned aircraft killed 10 militants
minutes apart in Nawab village on the border with Afghanistan.
"At least 10 people were killed when US drones fired missiles at three
vehicles," a senior security official told AFP.
"First a US drone fired missiles at a double-cabin pick-up truck and about 15
minutes later two more cars were struck," he said.
Security and intelligence officials in Miranshah and Peshawar confirmed the
strikes and the death toll.
