<a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/sultan-brunei-divorces-third-wife-0">News from the Sultanate of Bruenei.</a> (I don't know where that is either.)
"The Sultan has divorced his wife Azrinaz Mazhar Hakim and all the royal titles that have been awarded to the Sultan's former wife have been withdrawn," Grand chamberlain Haji Alauddin Haji Abu Bakar announced on Radio Television Brunei.
He said the divorce was granted based on "special reasons" but no other details were given. Rumours of the royal break-up had been circulating in the capital in recent weeks.
During their marriage, Azrinaz bore two children, adding to the Sultan's 10 heirs from earlier marriages.
The pair married in a private ceremony in Kuala Lumpur in 2005.
The ruler remains married to his first wife Anak Hajah Saleha and their son Prince Al Muhtadee Billah Bolkiah, is the present heir to the throne.
No word on the opinion of wife #1

The better questions is: does the first wife GET an opinion?
Considering this is his second divorce of his second wife, it sounds to me as if he just likes ****ing around.

But if you are king you just convince people to give you their money.
Or if they are reluctant you get other people to take their money for you.

Politicians are just more subtle about it.
It is after all a vital part of the United States of America's function.
