Youcef Nadarkhani has been executed in Iran. He is the Christian pastor who has been imprisoned and found guilty by the courts in Iran of being a Christian. Now heÂ’s been executed in spite of international appeals to spare his life. He was hanged today.
This remains unconfirmed and so, hope still lives.
Newsmax says he is still alive and other sources report his death is as yet unconfirmed.
Continue to pray for his release, for his family and community and for other believers in Iran and other Islamic countries.
but martyrs are never brought low in heaven
Like I said, it only takes one idiot to ruin it for the rest of us!!!!!!!
UNFORGIVABLE?????!!!!!!!!!
Execution rumors false?
That's what I thought. I thought he converted, seeing that he could spare Christ the pain of the cross for as much as he could himself recieve Karma for his sins......
And now he has lovers in two countries!!! and, perhaps, converts tooooooo............!
he learn to espeaka de language and slippy in some Jesus.../.....when they not looking.......
Lord knows I'm sick of my kids, and I don't even have them!!!!
Here is an article giving us an idea what will probably happen to many Christian women in the future in Islamic nations:
Well he's gone to be with the Lord, which is better by far. Our prayers are with his loved ones.
Maybe those people who say Islam is peace will sit up and take note.
