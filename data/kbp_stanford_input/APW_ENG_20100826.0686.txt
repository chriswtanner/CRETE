Spain extradites war crimes suspect to Bosnia

A Montenegrin man suspected of murdering, raping and torturing civilians during Bosnia's 1992-95 war was extradited to the Balkan country to face trial.
Veselin Vlahovic was extradited Thursday by Spain, which had arrested him in March for robbery and assault with a firearm.
Vlahovic is known as "the monster of Grbavica," a reference to a Sarajevo suburb where he is alleged to have committed crimes, including the killings of women and children, while fighting for the Serb side in the Bosnian war.
Spain's government decided to allow his extradition to Bosnia although he was also wanted in Montenegro and Serbia on charges ranging from armed robbery to war crimes.
Vlahovic was jailed in Montenegro for banditry and violent behavior but escaped from prison in 2001 and vanished.
