"Can't We All Get Along?" - Apparently, Rodney Still Doesn't Know How
RIALTO, Calif. Â— Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police led to deadly riots in 1992, was arrested after he allegedly threatened his daughter and ex-girlfriend, police said.
King, 40, was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of making criminal threats. He was being held on $25,000 bail.
He was accused of threatening to kill his 23-year-old daughter, Candace, and her mother, Carmen Simpson, after the two got in a fight with King's current girlfriend, Dawn Jean. All three women live in King's home.
The daughter, who called police, said King was armed with a handgun, but it turned out to be a toy, according to authorities.
King's videotaped beating after he was stopped for speeding shocked the nation when it was shown repeatedly on television newscasts. After the four white police officers charged in the beating were acquitted of most charges, Los Angeles erupted in riots that left 55 people dead and caused $1 billion in property damage.
King sued the city for the beating, eventually settling for $3.8 million.
Since the beating, he has had a string of run-ins with the law. He walks with a limp since a 2003 accident in which he lost control of his car, crashed into a house at 100 mph and shattered his pelvis.
All three women live in King's home.
Holy Chit! wow...that dude is the master of self-destruction.
What an idiot this guy is. Nobody deserves to get beaten like he did, but that doesn't in any way excuse him from threatening three women.

Maybe they are bitches...and deserve the threat. (shrug)
I don't know man, I hate seeing men beat up on women. Unless they're pointing a gun at your nuts, there are always other ways to settle your differences.

You've obviously never lived with a nagging woman. Only a few things bother me...Nuclear War...Carnies...and Women who fight, hit, yell and scream, only to play the victim when they get smacked.
I know a guy who walked in on his wife and another man. He smacked her. SHE called police, and had him arrested.

..because he assaulted her...

Actually, if ANYONE ever deserved a beating like that it IS this moron...
Obviously, however, the beating didn't help long-term as he is still very much an idiot...
what a waste of skin this guy is. and to think, hes sucking up our oxygen!
..because he assaulted her...
...because she deserved it
(shrug).
She 'assulted him' emotional. He was defending himself.

Yes, but physical assault is illegal. Emotional assault is not. Sleeping around isn't a crime.
But does emotional damage ever warrant the use of violence?

But you agree, he was justified in what he did.

Yup.

Okay then.
And?
But does emotional damage ever warrant the use of violence?
id say so. if he told her everytime he saw her that he was going to kill her, after some time that would set in. she would actually believe that after a period of time and be scared for real that he was going to kill her
But it would only be violence if she set out to hunt him down. Defending herself from an attack would be an entirely different story. And terroristic threats aren't violence, they are a threat of violence. See the diff? Hahaha. Sorry.

but if shes brainwashed, its real in her mind. and if given the chance shes going to protect herself.
But you agree, he was justified in what he did.
Not legally. There's nothing wrong with a little restraint.
but if shes brainwashed, its real in her mind. and if given the chance shes going to protect herself.
Is it justified, then, for his friends or family to hunt and kill her then in response?

Nope. There are better ways to get revenge. That's why God made rat bastard divorce lawyers.
In families like mine in which there are lawyers, we prefer the term "triple cut throat" to "rat bastard."
what you guys are failing to understand brainwashing part. in her mind she is convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt he is going to do. regardless of hes just telling her that.

would they be brainwashed? if so, how werre they brainwashed? or jsut acting out in anger that she did it?
So where does the use of violence come in? In this hypothetical situation, are you suggesting that the girl actively seeks the man out to use violence against him or that she uses violence against the guy as self defense? Because self defense is always okay. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/dance.gif"/>

mental abuse. its more damaging, barring death, that can happen. broken bones heal, mental damage takes years and years to heal, then sometimes not fully.
would they be brainwashed? if so, how werre they brainwashed? or jsut acting out in anger that she did it?
No, they're angry that he was killed. No brainwashing. She was brainwashed and killed him. They, in response, kill her.

If a bully fucks with one of my kids, teases them, torments them, harrasses them to the point one of my kids - or both of them - jump the bastard and give him an ass-whooping, I'd be supportive of my children.
If Saddam Hussein claims to have WMD...Brags about WMD...and it's not legal for him to HAVE them, Violence is acceptable to ensure he's full of shit. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
No, they're angry that he was killed. No brainwashing. She was brainwashed and killed him. They, in response, kill her.
thenhow would that be justified?
I'm lost now in all the talk of brainwashing. Wouldn't she just be able to get a restraining order on the guy or have him arrested for making terroristic threats?
In families like mine in which there are lawyers, we prefer the term "triple cut throat" to "rat bastard."
Well, since I am one myself, I think i can use any term I like. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>
thenhow would that be justified?
I'm asking you. If you don't think it's justified to kill in retaliation to someone being killed, then fine. I'm just trying to see what is and is not justified.

its an ugly thing

to me no i wouldnt be justfied. jsut because she got mind fucked by him to the point of where she truly thought her life was in danger and her only way out was to kill him before he killed her.

Sounds reasonable to me.
What would anyone do when they caught their spouse engadged in a act of this type...well speaking from experience...many decades ago I walked in on my first wife in the same situation... as related in this post...at the time I worked for LAPD...when the young man hurriedly got out of the bed I threw him a hard right...he went sailing into a rocking chair my wifes dad had given us..it broke on impact..I started to laugh as I did not like the chair or my father-in-law.
The young man said...I did not know she was married...I apologized to him and threw him $20.00 and told him to go get a good piece..I told her to pack her shit and get...Justice was served! :halo:
But battered wife syndrome comes from being battered. So killing the guy would still be in self defense and therefore justified.
The problem with battered wife syndrome is that it's hard to prove unless there has been documentation in photos and police reports. That's a good lesson to keep in mind ladies. Don't put up with any physical abuse ever. Document it and file a police report and hold it over the c*cksucker's head for the rest of his life if you have to. There are enough gorillas living in the zoos, we don't have to put up with them living among us.
And for god's sake, don't live with an abusive sh*thead. Move out, get a divorce and a restraining order.

Very smoothly handled.

you dont believe you can be mentally battered? say as in mental abuse? im sure Archangel has seen his share of mentally battered women... well im going to say spouses not just women, but it is typically women.
Sure, mental battery is a reality. But it doesn't excuse physical violence because there are other smarter and more peaceful ways to deal with it.

After many years of responding to domestic abuse I found for the most part mental abuse was about equal...and men are more powerful so when they hit back it is usually more severe....sometimes women do instigate the physical abuse by mental abuse and also hit first...In a perfect world all would just walk away...but human emotion is a powerful thing! :coffee3:

i think your missing what im trying to convey. breaking someones mind after years of mental abuse will do strange things to people. the abused will think totally diffferent. its ground into their heads that this is going to happen, they know for certain its going to happen.
dont they have it in your country? not trying to be a dick or anything, just wondering
Yeah, I live in the US. I've heard of mental battery. But what does that have to do with physical battery? Are you asking if I think mental battery could provoke a person to violence against the batterer? The answer is "of course." It's been documented in many cases where a woman kills her husband and then claims that the husband mentally abused her and drove her to kill him out of fear for her own life.
The key phrase here is "fear for her own life." So if an array of mental battery totally conviced someone that their life was at stake, then I think they would have a good argument that they were forced to kill out of self defense. This would be totally morally justified, but, like physical battery, it would be hard to prove without evidence to support the claims. You'd have to have recordings, journal entries, or witnesses to prove a claim like that. And even then, I think a "man slaughter" conviction might still be a just punishment for a person like this because unless they were actually being attacked at the time they chose to defend themselves (in which case it would just be a cut and dry self defense case), they would still have set out to commit murder. It's mighty complex and ugly.

true enough! if it was all documented, then it should be too big of a case. if not, its going to be a tough road.
It looks like Rodney has a bad case of 'Battered Idiot's Syndrome'.
Some of the symptoms are:
1. You can say anything you want and get in the news.
2. You tell people on the news to do what you are unwilling to do and then go and do the opposite...
I hear that a prescription of "shut the f**k up" when filled properly can solve this problem.
