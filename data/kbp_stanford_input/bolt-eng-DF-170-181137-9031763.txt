NY Jets conditioning coach admits to tripping Miami player. Should he be fired?
Did you see the play? What do you think his punishment should be?

I picked other
Fined and Fired.
Fired, fined and arrested for assault.
Fired, fined and arrested for assault.
LOL We think alike here ravi. I actually edited this out of my post before posting "If the player was hurt he should be charged with assult and possibly sued for any lost revenue to the player"
It does make perfect legal sense, actually, to charge him with both assault and battery.
I think he should be fired.
An interesting thread about this on a Jets forum. Seems the consensus is that the dude be fired.
LOL, here's a great interview including some very articulate Dolphin players!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
Fired.
Suspended without pay. He should also be applauded for admiting wrongdoing immediately. Anyone who has strapped it on knows the emotion of the game; it's not the first time nor the last someone will act without malice of forethought. See the most famous one, 1954 Cotton Bowl:

I can't miss an opportunity to make this political....
Rush Limbaugh just commented that if the Jet coach were a Democrat candidate, there would be even more attention to this situation, including slo-mo shots, still actions, vids from every angle, and finally, after all the conversation, conjecture, and interviews, the coach would be found innocent, and the Dolphin player suspended....
Funny guy, Limbaugh...
OK, MedsInTheClinic, the door's open.....c'mon in!

*yawn*
the dude should be fined and fired.

It is not all that often that I agree with Wry, but in this case, it is my opinion that his two above expressed opinions are right on the money.
Sorry, Wry, if this post causes you angst or makes you have to reconsider! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>
He should be fired. The Jets should be fined.
its football......ex felons play....it all says....win at any cost...dont get all moral now
No. I think he should be fined, suspended for the rest of the season, and the Jets should have to surrender a mid-round draft pick.

I disagree with that. I think that the man himself should suffer the consequences for his personal choices and actions, unless it is proven that he was instructed by his higher ups to try and disrupt players who are running along the sidelines.
Let the Jets fire him, and the league impose a fine. And if the legal system chooses to prosecute him on assault and battery, then that's okay by me.

Can we do both your ideas together?
Wear Sanchez's soiled jockstrap on his head for the rest of the season.
Suspended without pay. He should also be applauded for admiting wrongdoing immediately.* * * *

Nope, neither. I find your moment of clarity a sign of hope.
Fired and Fined, why punish the team for this idiots actions?
Then make him send a pic of his junk to Brett Favre.

I don't consider my genitals to be "junk".

The Broncos were fined earlier in the year when one of their staff members taped a practice...and this is even after they fired the guy for doing it.
As I see it, coaches shouldn't be fined by the league like players would be. But team should be fined, and the team can then fine the coach if they want to.
