Man says he has right to have sex with children

Last update: August 03, 2006  6:16 AM
CLEVELAND  A man accused of sexually assaulting nine boys with physical or mental disabilities told a judge that having sex with children is a sacred ritual protected by civil rights laws.
Phillip Distasio, who said he is the leader of a church called Arcadian Fields Ministries, represented himself at his pretrial hearing Wednesday. He is charged with 74 counts including rape, pandering obscenity to minors and corrupting another with drugs.
"I'm a pedophile. I've been a pedophile for 20 years," he said in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Wednesday. "The only reason I'm charged with rape is that no one believes a child can consent to sex. The role of my ministry is to get these cases out of the courtrooms."
Distasio said some of his congregants are among the victims in this case. Distacio, of Rocky River, is accused of molesting two disabled boys he tutored at his home and raping seven autistic boys at a Cleveland school for special-needs students where he was a teacher's aide. All but one of the victims were under 13.
A conviction on rape counts involving any of the eight younger boys would mean an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole eligibility, prosecutors said.
Distasio tried unsuccessfully in June to fire his court-appointed lawyer because he wouldn't pursue a religious freedom defense. Distasio could represent himself if the attorney remained as an adviser, Judge Kathleen Sutula said.
Rocky River is 9 miles west of Cleveland.
A lot of us saw this coming(no pun intended)....You open up Pandora's box and don't be surprised with the deprived, degenerate, distgusting human waste pours out.
Ohio Man Claims Right To Have Sex With Boys
Admitted Pedophile Says Children Can Consent
POSTED: 6:52 am EDT August 3, 2006
CLEVELAND -- It was probably not a defense the court had heard before.
A suburban Cleveland man accused of sexually assaulting nine disabled boys told a judge Wednesday that his apartment was a religious sanctuary where smoking marijuana and having sex with children are sacred rituals protected by civil rights laws.
The admitted pedophile offered a surprising defense Wednesday to 74 charges of rape, drugs and pandering obscenity to minors.
Appearing in an Ohio court for a pretrial hearing, Phillip Distasio, 34, of Rocky River, Ohio, said he was a pedophile.
He told the judge, "I'm a pedophile. I've been a pedophile for 20 years. The only reason I'm charged with rape is that no one believes a child can consent to sex. The role of my ministry is to get these cases out of the courtrooms."
Distasio, a self-professed pagan friar, is representing himself on 74 charges. He said he's the leader of a church called Arcadian Fields Ministries, and that some of his congregants are among the victims in his case.
The judge told Distasio to confine his arguments to secular laws at his trial, scheduled to begin Sept. 11.
"If you want to challenge the law, that's your right to do so," Judge Kathleen Sutula said. "But we're going to follow the laws of Ohio in this courtroom."
Cuyahoga County Bill Mason said Distasio was arrested after he wanted to write a blog for the Lakewood Library. Officials noticed something was wrong and notified Rocky River police.
Distasio was arrested on charges he molested two disabled boys he was tutoring at his home. He's also accused of raping seven other autistic children at a Cleveland school for special-needs students, The Plain Dealer reported. All but one of the boys was under 13, which carries a mandatory life-in-prison sentence if he is convicted, the paper reported.
Police said they found journals at Distasio's apartment in which he described his illegal activities, along with child pornography and videotapes of him engaged in sex with boys, The Plain Dealer reported
"Not all pedophilia is bad, and sex [with boys] can be healthy," Distasio told the court.
According to the journals, two of Distasio's victims were so helpless they could never tell anyone what happened.
"The defendant describes acts in which he had autistic children and he did what I would call sadistic sexual acts with these children," said Mason.
The school he ran from his apartment was called Class Cutters. According to Distasio's Web site, students and parents chose the curriculum in the school for unique children.
But prosecutors said it was little more than a trap that snared one victim and then another.
"Like all predators, he used this one child to bring other children to him and that's what was happening, and that's how he got his second victim," said Mason.
And prosecutors believe there may be more victims.
Distasio has a history of working with children dating back 10 years.
Prosecutors said he could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.

Because obviously anyone who thinks that Social Security is a good program that helps the elderly also supports pedophilia.
LOL...yeah, it's liberalism that's lead to this guy being a paedophile...sure...RATFLMAO...What next, liberalism was responsible for the nazis? Or how about the influenza epidemic of 1918? :tdown2:

No. Liberalism is repsonsible for making pedophiles, transsexuals, people that have sex with animals, etc be seen as normal by us uneducated masses. They didnt cause these people to be freaks. They worked on changing the minds of the masses to make it seem like these people arent freaks. I.E. ACLU.
The right to marry a 9 year old boy debate will be coming soon and the ACLU and the left will be leading the charge for his rights.

Really? the ACLU are for paedophiles? Got a link? As for homosexuals, transexuals....like hetros, if they are of age, who cares. it's their life not yours. If they start pulling down churches, or demanding you don't have sex with your wife, you might have a point. But unlike neocons, most homos I know are live and let live kinda people. IE, they don't interfere with other's lives...

just little stuff like trying to change the meaning of marriage which happens to be quite an old hetero "custom", "tradition" or "Institution".

Perhaps we just don't understand why you care what other consenting adults do with their lives...regardless of what one calls it.
By the by, until "liberals" came along, segregation was okay, too. Seems that was a "custom", "tradition" or "Institution", too.
I really thought you and Grump were Pro-homosexual rights. What if that guy was BORN wanting to screw little boys?

I'm Pro Absolute Right and Absolute Wrong. Homosexuality is WRONG. It's destructive and bad behaviour. This guy is just ONE example of homosexuality gone rampant; a homosexual who was never taught to control his urges. If this guy were cured of his homosexuality, those poor kids would never have been raped.

So, using your logic, if the killer of Polly Klass had been cured of his hetrosexuality, she would still be alive?

The difference is, heterosexuals speak out against that shit. Homoseuxals never hold their own lifestyle accountable. They deflect: "He's not a HOMOSexual...he's a pedophile!"

Well it's true. They are paedophiles. I know the anti-home brigade love putting them in the same box, which is probably why they say that. I don't see homos trying to put hetro paedophiles in the same box at hetros. Are you surprised at their reaction?

Grump made the claim that homos just sit around and mind thier own business--I disagreed

In other words if American society started teaching that homosexuality was wrong ad we stopped coddling these degenerates most of this shit would never happen.

Absolutely, with all the voluminous factual information out there showing that queers are more apt to be pedophelic, queers still deny that there is a problem, in fact they never acknowledge a problem or at least the extent of a problem and anybody who dares point it out is labeled a bigot and a homophobe.
Ever hear of Nambla? Hell they even champion pedophilia.

Maybe its because we arent selfish enough to believe that what we do doesnt effect others.
No one is an island. No one stands alone. Every act we choose effects the world around us. Either to act or react. And many of us understand the consequences of perverse behavior.

It takes a "special" mind to make a link between homosexuality and pedophilia. If this particular pedophile liked little girls, would you be blaming that on homosexuality too?
How about posting some facts and figures on how many homosexuals have actually been cured. Your whole argument is a farce...you claim homosexuals can be cured, but think that pedophiles should be locked up forever(I do too) because they can't be.
Children are molested by pedophiles, not by homosexuals or heterosexuals.

Bullshit! The majority of pedophiles are men who seek out girls...preaching that homosexuality is wrong isn't going to affect that at all.

Only stupid people would make such a demand as you have. Everyone knows liberals believe in Morality based on individual preferences. Seriously. Liberals are constantly spouting gems like "If HE prefers (insert activity) who am I to say it's wrong?"

Duh! NAMBLA is an association of pedophiles. What other cause would you expect them to champion?

As a liberal, I can honestly say that I do not believe in the "...Morality based on individual preferences..." BS you are spouting.
What I do believe in is a morality rooted in the consequences to this human life...in this world. The consequences to human life are the yard-stick by which I measure the morality or immorality of a given action.
Your "everyone knows" argument is a hot, steaming load of <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/bs1.gif"/>, and you know it.

Outside of marches around the world - forcing their sickness on others, disruppting business and traffic - they've never "interfere'd with others"...

Not at all - cause I'm a sane person... What bothers me is them spewing their poisonous lifestyle as somehow "normal"...

What's the chance he just does the same thing to little girls instead? Curing someone of a destructive behavior does not cure them of all destructive behaviors. Although it'd be cool if it did.

The problem isn't people not wanting to say "A homosexual raped a child" its people not wanting to follow your reasoning that "A homosexual raped a child because they're a homosexual".

If the guy was NOT a homosexual - if the guy did not DO homosexuality, those kids would be fine. Heterosexual pedophilia happens - sure does. And it's just as nauseating; yet nobody is trying to force heterosexual pedophilia down our throats as 'acceptable'. We can't do anything about heterosexuality because it's biological sound and normal. We can, however, do something about homosexuality - treat it like the disease it is. Encourage treatment for those who participate.

Wait, you can cure someone of wanting to have sexual relations with the same gender, but you can't cure them of wanting to have sexual relations with children of the other gender?

I haven't seen any gay rights activists seeking to define pedophilia as acceptable.
Are you suggesting that heterosexual pedophiles aren't cureable, but homosexual pedophiles are?
Actually, most pedophiles are heterosexuals.
The homophobes just love linking the two because they get more bang for their buck that way. :sleepy1:

Ask and ye shall receive.
No most homos and child predators are looking to be seen as normal. Demanding that the public see abnormal activites as normal is the problem.

Homosexuals try separating pedophiles from everything, as it suits their cause.
And yeah, a pedophile that attack little boys is a homosexual pedophile. Not real hard math.
And yeah, a pedophile that attack little boys is a homosexual pedophile.
True statement!
What some of us are trying to get some others to understand is this statement is not an indicator that homosexuality equals pedophilia or leads to pedophilia. In the same way that you and I don't consider heterosexual pedophiles to be fellow heterosexuals, I imagine that homosexuals try to maintain a distinction between themselves and homosexual pedophiles. This seems reasonable to me.

So they have two problems instead of one. One does not negate the other.

To suggest that homosexual pedophilia is not a separate condition from homosexuality is pure speculation on your part. As opposed to speculation as you present yourself in another thread, I'm surprised to see you embrace it here.
