SAN DIEGO (AP) Â— A con-man-turned-pastor has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for embezzling $3 million from his San Diego church congregation.
Barry Minkow was ordered Monday to do the time after he completes a Florida sentence of up to 21 months for an unrelated fraud.
Minkow, who's 47, became famous as a teenager for founding the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company. It made him a millionaire but was embroiled in a $100 million fraud scheme. Minkow went to prison, was released in 1995 and two years later became pastor of the San Diego Community Bible Church.
