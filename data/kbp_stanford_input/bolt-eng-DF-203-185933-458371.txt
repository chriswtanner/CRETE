Let me tell you the story of my day.....
Today, I agreed to help two friends, K and A, make wedding invitations for their niece. Waste of my Saturday....blah....let me tell you why!
#1: The bride is the most immature 20 year old I have EVER met. For reelz. She quit her job at a large retail store because she got in trouble. She said, "I don't need that crap!" Now she working at some place where she works 12 hours a week and complains that they don't have money.....
#2: The bride told my friend, K, that they would need about 200 invites. This was about 2 months ago. So K cut most of the pieces to be ready for today. She comes today and says, "My mom said we only need 60 invites". Umm.....really?!?! And the kicker is: They don't even have a freakin' guest list to really know the numbers. We made 100 invites.
#3: They are getting married in 4 months: They have no cake, no photographer, no menu, and no church set up.
#4: And the best one: They plan to get pg right away, so she/they can get back on assistance. Awesome....
The best part of the day was 2:00, when everyone left and it was me, K and A. Thank goodness for small miracles.
Thanks for listening to me vent!!
Uhm, this girl sounds like trash. Reading this post made me angry.
I hate when you spend time helping people and walk away thinking "now there was six hours of my life I'll never get back." The bride sounds like a real gem... and a bright one at that!
Ummm...I give you credit. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't have been able to keep my opinions to myself!

Speaking of her being bright.....
Someone had a bottle of water and she had put in a slice of lemon. The bride said "How in the world did you get that lemon in there? Did you cut the lemon? I mean the hole of the bottle is so small and that lemon is huge!"
::facepalm::
Wow, I think I would have been livid at that point. Someone needs to tell that girl to grow the F up, and perhaps give her a throat punch.
I don't know how many times I wanted to quit my retail job, but knew the cash was more important than my pride. Grrr....

Welp. That seems like a perfectly logical question...

This. Or I would have had to drink heavily to make it through.

This!!
Dang! That really sucks! I'm sorry! (hopefully her V gets sewn shut before then!)
This post made me so angry. I hate ungrateful people. I would have told her to do the invites herself. I probably also would have punched her if I found out about her trying to get PG right away.
Ummm.... She wants to get pg so they can get welfare!?!
This makes me so angry. You should have refused to help. Haha
