Six same-sex couples are suing the state of Florida for the right to marry. While most remember Californias Prop 8 and its subsequent demise  few remember that on the same day in 2008 that California voters chose to write discrimination into their constitution, so did voters in the Sunshine State.
Those six couples, along with the Equality Florida Institute and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), held a press conference in Miami today to discuss the case.
Florida is our home, it is where we are raising our child, and where we want to get married, said Catherina Pareto, who was joined by her partner, Karla Arguello. Karla and I wish for our family the same things that other families want. We want to build our lives together, provide a safe and caring home for our child, and share in the responsibilities and protections of marriage.
Famed attorney Shannon Minter, now of NCLR, told reporters, The law should support families, not make it harder for committed couples to support one another and protect their children. Barring same-sex couples from marriage causes great harms to their families and children while helping no one.
