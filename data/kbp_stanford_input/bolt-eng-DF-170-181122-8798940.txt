Minnesota's publicly funded Islamic school
Islamic Studies was also incorporated into the school day. When I arrived, I was told after school we have Islamic Studies, and I might have to stay for hall duty, Getz said. The teachers had written assignments on the blackboard for classes like math and social studies. Islamic Studies was the last one  the board said the kids were studying the Quran. The students were told to copy it into their planner, along with everything else. That gave me the impression that Islamic Studies was a subject like any other.

If this were a christian school funded by taxpayer dollars the ACLU would be descending on it like locusts.
Well that is just different after all.

Yup!
Yup!
And the left on this board would be screaming bloody murder on this thread if this were about a Christian school supported by the Government.
You bet!
Islam is "diversity". Christianity is "bigotry." Judaism is "victimhood."
That's your lesson for today, class.
Where is the HUE and CRY from our liberal buddies? Maineman? Reilly? Larkinn? Jillian? DCD? Rayboy? And all the rest?
Another poster example of why the separation of church and state is a good idea. Thankfully, the ACLU is preparing a lawsuit against these religious whackjobs.

Yeah, I was wondering where all the left's unbridled outrage is on this.
What no replies about the ACLU taking action. Hmmmmm, I guess the original statement falls sort of flat. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

More drivel from the driveler. I don't see any lefties supporting this.
You need to use facts some times just for a change./ <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/uhh.gif"/>

Sorry. I just hadn't read the thread yet. I have no problem with religious studies being included in a public school curriculum as long as it is a comparative and critical study of religion generally. That doesn't appear to be the case in this instance, so I disagree with this. I am all for a stricter separation of church and state.
Satisfied?

What facts?
I have yet to see a link to where the ACLU is preparing a case against this school....
Just because someone said it doesnt make it so.

I did but I found nothing....
So are you telling me you cant provide a link?

No, I'm not telling you that. I'm telling you to have a little initiative and investigate things you read on message boards yourself. It's really not that difficult.

I guess Dr. Grump is correct about your IQ.
Why? Because you can make a statement and declare it fact with NO evidence?

The evidence is out there. I'm not your research assistant.
I don't know enough about what charter schools are to be able to know what to say. If charter schools aren't allowed to teach other religions, then they shouldn't be allowed to teach this.
Also, I have to say that I do think that there is a lot of value in teaching all kids about Islam, just the basics without presenting it as "look at how great this is, don't you want to be one?"
The more you know about your enemy, the better off you are. Not that all of Islam is our enemy, but sticking our heads in the sand and not learning how they think is not going to do us any good.
We have a shortage of people who can translate the languages the military need translated, too. Maybe if we get kids exposed to this stuff as kind of a cultural discovery kind of thing, later on in life they'll be interested in learning the languages and working for the government or military.

One can not make a claim and call it fact when there is nothing to back it up. Otherwise it is JUST your opinion.

Minor clarification.
They are currently conducting an investigation of the school. They haven't made a decision whether to file a lawsuit yet. They don't currently have enough information to know whether it is a violation of the 1st Amendment.
ACLU-MN opens investigation of Tarek Academy
For Immediate Release
March 18, 2008
After receiving complaints that Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy in Inver Grove Heights is violating the Establishment Clause the ACLU-MN sent a letter to the academy questioning their practices. In the letter that was sent the ACLU-MN questions some of their practices, including addressing allegations that the school sponsors prayer.
Teresa Nelson, an attorney for the ACLU of Minnesota, says "We currently do not have enough facts to state whether or not the school is in violation of the establishment clause. The American Civil Liberties Union is a strong defender of separation of church and state and will take action if we find they are violating the establishment clause."
You can also read the letter that was sent to Tarek Academy.
Are you really THIS fucking stupid, dread? I mean, can you function on a day to day basis without some form of fucking assistance? do you wear a bib? Are you enjoying your extra chromosome? did it really take a liberal to have to provide for you a link from the MINN. ACLU regarding this issue or are your grubby fucking dickskinning paws simply incapable of typing anything other than <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com?">www.drudgereport.com?</a>
Good grief, as if its any standard liberal job to show you what you SHOULD be intelligent enough to fucking find on your own..
ps, did you notice the fucking link to my source? I'd hate for you to feel it necessary to post retarded fucking threads about lefties who don't cite sources and all. I mean, i realize I had to say the password and perform the secret fucking liberal handshake before I could access the website of the ACLU of Minn. and all but perhaps you have the three time consuming seconds to google this shit up for yourself the next time.
Hey, MAYBE since we are talking about evil muslims we can just chuck the fucking due process out the window and kick the fucking door in, eh? I mean, THAT IS the kind of shit you expect to see with boo fucking hoo christians each time THEY try to pray around the fucking flagpole, isnt it?

Why did you have to do that? It was fun watching him froth.
We need to know what the specifics are as government supports Christian schools as well through both materials and transportation. I know this as I know lots of teachers. And the thing that always strikes me from conversations with teachers in public schools is it is usually the Christian and Jewish students who complain the most about things at school that do not fit their particular religious notions.
And write the ACLU and see what they say, I'll do it if you can't.
I see Shogun answered this question.
This turned out to be a very amusing thread.
It was another one of those diversions. You don't do it so why should we crap.
I also emailed the ACLU. I went on their site but coulnd't find specifics.
I emailed the ACLU and the dept of education.
I posted this somewhere else on this site previously...
Did you guys catch that the super didn't have an American flag (a requirement for public schools) because he didn't know how to work the flag pole?
