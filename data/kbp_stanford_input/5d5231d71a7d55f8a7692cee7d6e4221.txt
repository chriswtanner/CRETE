The former mayor of Detroit, Michigan was sentenced to 28 years in prison on Thursday after being found guilty of committing racketeering conspiracy, fraud, extortion and tax crimes during his stint in office.
Prosecutors asked for a minimum of 28 years for Kilpatrick, who resigned from the mayors office in 2008 amid an unrelated scandal. Defense attorneys, the Associated Press, reported hoped for only a decade-and-a-half.
At the very least, a significant sentence will send a message that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated, Judge Nancy G. Edmunds of United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan said before she made her determination early Thursday.
The government has asked for a sentence of 28 years, Edmunds said. I believe that is in fact what his sentence should be.
According to Barbara McQuade, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Edmunds ruling is"equal to the longest sentence" for corruption ever handed down to a public official.
