Google gives ground to Europe over digital books deal: report
LONDON, Sept 7, 2009 (AFP)
Google will make concessions to European publishers and authors in an attempt to
stem rising anger over its move to digitise and sell millions of books online, a
report said Monday.
The company has agreed to have two non-US representatives on the board of a body
that will administer a US legal settlement over the controversial online
project, the Financial Times said.
The newspaper cited a letter sent to 16 European Union publishers'
representatives at the weekend.
According to the letter, Google also promises to consult European publishers
before cataloguing some European works in its digital library.
Google reached a class action settlement in October last year with the Authors
Guild and the Association of American Publishers to a copyright infringement
suit they filed against the Internet powerhouse in 2005.
Under the settlement, Google agreed to pay 125 million dollars to resolve
outstanding claims and establish an independent "Book Rights Registry," which
will provide revenue from sales and advertising to authors and publishers who
agree to digitise their books.
Germany said last week it opposed the legal settlement, arguing it violated
international treaties on authors' rights.
The European Commission is set to hold hearings Monday on how it should respond
to the deal.
Google declined to comment on the FT's report.
