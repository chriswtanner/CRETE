Jack said, "Look, Janet! A mitten is gone. What did you do with it? Where has it gone?"
Janet said, "What mitten, Jack? Here is a mitten."
Mother said, "Look, Janet. This mitten is gone. There is no mitten here."
Janet said, "Where did it go? I will have to find it. Where will I look?"
Mother said, "Did you find it? Did you see your mitten here?"
Janet said, "No, Mother. My mitten is not there. I will have to find it."
"Where can my mitten be? Where will I look? Who has my mitten?"
Penny said, "No, Tip. This is not my mitten. There are my mittens."
Jack said, "Let me see it, Tip. Janet can not find her mitten. Can this mitten be hers?"
"It is her mitten. Go home with it, Tip. Give it to Janet."
